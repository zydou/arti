BREAKING: `client::TorClient<R>::launch_onion_service()` and `client::TorClient<R>::launch_onion_service_with_hsid()` now return `Result<Option<(Arc<tor_hsservice::RunningOnionService>, impl futures::Stream<Item = tor_hsservice::RendRequest> + use<R>,)>` (the `Option` is new), returning `Ok(None)` if the service is disabled in the config.
BREAKING: `tor_hsservice::config::OnionServiceConfigBuilder` and `tor_hsservice::config::OnionServiceConfig` had breaking changes and are used in the public API of this crate.
