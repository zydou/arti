/// Implementation notes
///
/// We build our logging in a few layers.
///
/// At the lowest level, there is a [`Loggable`] trait, for events which can
/// accumulate and eventually be flushed; this combines with the
/// [`RateLim`](ratelim::RateLim) structure, which is responsible for managing
/// the decision of when to flush these [`Loggable`]s.
///
/// The role of RateLim is to decide
/// when to flush the information in a `Loggable`,
/// and to flush the `Loggable` as needed.
/// The role of a `Loggable` is to
/// accumulate information
/// and to know how to flush that information as a log message
/// when it is told to do so.
///
/// One layer up, there is [`LogState`](logstate::LogState), which is used to to
/// implement `Loggable` as used by [`log_ratelim!`].
/// It can remember the name of an activity, accumulate
/// successes and failures, and remember an error and associated message.
///
/// The highest layer is the [`log_ratelim!`] macro, which uses
/// [`RateLim`](ratelim::RateLim) and [`LogState`](logstate::LogState) to record
/// successes and failures, and launch background tasks as needed.
