//! Implement Tor's sort-of-Pareto estimator for circuit build timeouts.
//!
//! Our build times don't truly follow a
//! [Pareto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution)
//! distribution; instead they seem to be closer to a
//! [Fréchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_distribution)
//! distribution.  But those are hard to work with, and we only care
//! about the right tail, so we're using Pareto instead.
//!
//! This estimator also includes several heuristics and kludges to
//! try to behave better on unreliable networks.
//! For more information on the exact algorithms and their rationales,
//! see [`path-spec.txt`](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/torspec/-/blob/master/path-spec.txt).
