# Configure logging

# Specify filtering directives for sending trace messages to the console
# (via standard output).
#
# It can be as simple as a single loglevel, or as complicated as a
# list with per-module settings.
#
# You can override this setting with the -l, --log-level command-line option.
#
# Example:
#     trace_filter = "info,tor_proto::channel=trace"
#
# For more information, see https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/0.2.20/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html

# the journald logging system.  Empty string means not to use journald.

# You can also configure one or more log files, with different filters, and optional

#         {path = "~/logs/trace.log", filter="trace", rotate="daily"},
