//! Saving/loading timestamps to disk
//!
//! Storing timestamps on disk is not so straightforward.
//! We need to use wall clock time in order to survive restarts.
//! But wall clocks can be wrong,
//! so we need at least to apply some sanity checks.
//!
//! This module encapsulates those checks, and some error handling choices.
//! It allows `Instant`s to be used while the system is running,
//! with bespoke types for loading/saving.
//! See [`Loading::load_future`] for the load/save guarantees provided.
//!
//! The initial entrypoints are [`Storing::start`] and [`Loading::start`].
//!
//! Granularity is 1 second and the precise rounding behaviour is not specified.
//!
//! ### Data model
//!
//! To mitigate clock skew, we store the wall clock time at which
//! each timestamp was saved to disk ([`Reference`])
//! and the offset from now to that timestamp ([`FutureTimestamp`]).
//!
//! The same storage time can be used for multiple timestamps that are stored together.
//!
//! ### Example
//!
//! ```
//! use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
//! use std::time::{Duration, Instant};
//! use tor_rtcompat::{PreferredRuntime, SleepProvider as _};
//!
//! # use tor_hsservice::time_store_for_doctests_unstable_no_semver_guarantees as time_store;
//! # #[cfg(all)] // works like #[cfg(FALSE)].  Instead, we have this workaround ^.
//! use crate::time_store;
//!
//! let runtime = PreferredRuntime::create().unwrap();
//!
//! #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
//! struct Stored {
//!     time_ref: time_store::Reference,
//!     t0: time_store::FutureTimestamp,
//! }
//!
//! let t0: Instant = runtime.now() + Duration::from_secs(60);
//!
//! let storing = time_store::Storing::start(&runtime);
//! let data = Stored {
//!     time_ref: storing.store_ref(),
//!     t0: storing.store_future(t0),
//! };
//!
//! let json = serde_json::to_string(&data).unwrap();
//!
//! // later:
//!
//! let data: Stored = serde_json::from_str(&json).unwrap();
//! let loading = time_store::Loading::start(&runtime, data.time_ref);
//! let t0: Instant = loading.load_future(data.t0);
//!
//! assert!(t0 - runtime.now() <= Duration::from_secs(60));
//! ```
//!
//! ### Time arithmetic overflows and stupid system time settings
//!
//! Arithmetic is done with signed 64-bit numbers of seconds.
//! So overflow cannot occur unless the clock is completely ludicrous.
//! If the clock is ludicrous, time calculations are going to be a mess.
//! We treat this as clock skew, using saturating arithmetic, rather than returning errors.
//! Reasonable operation will resume when the clock becomes sane.
//
// We generally use u64 for values that can't, for our algorithms, be negative,
// but i64 for time_t's (even though negative time_t's can't happen on Unix).

// TODO - eventually we hope this will become pub, in another crate

// Rustdoc can complains if we link to these private docs from these docs which are
// themselves only formatted with --document-private-items.
// TODO - Remove when this is actually public
