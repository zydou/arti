//! Channel tasks of the arti-relay.
//!
//! The tasks are:
//!     * [`ChannelHouseKeepingTask`] which is in charge of regurlarly going over existing channels
//!       to clean up expiring ones and prune duplicates. At the start, it will run in
//!       [`ChannelHouseKeepingTask::START_TICK_TIME`] seconds and then the channel expiry function
//!       tells it how much time to sleep.
