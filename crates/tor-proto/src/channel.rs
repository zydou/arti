//! Code for talking directly (over a TLS connection) to a Tor client or relay.
//!
//! Channels form the basis of the rest of the Tor protocol: they are
//! the only way for two Tor instances to talk.
//!
//! Channels are not useful directly for application requests: after
//! making a channel, it needs to get used to build circuits, and the
//! circuits are used to anonymize streams.  The streams are the
//! objects corresponding to directory requests.
//!
//! In general, you shouldn't try to manage channels on your own;
//! use the `tor-chanmgr` crate instead.
//!
//! To launch a channel:
//!
//!  * Create a TLS connection as an object that implements AsyncRead +
//!    AsyncWrite + StreamOps, and pass it to a [ChannelBuilder].  This will
//!    yield an [handshake::ClientInitiatorHandshake] that represents
//!    the state of the handshake.
//!  * Call [handshake::ClientInitiatorHandshake::connect] on the result
//!    to negotiate the rest of the handshake.  This will verify
//!    syntactic correctness of the handshake, but not its cryptographic
//!    integrity.
//!  * Call [handshake::UnverifiedChannel::check] on the result.  This
//!    finishes the cryptographic checks.
//!  * Call [handshake::VerifiedChannel::finish] on the result. This
//!    completes the handshake and produces an open channel and Reactor.
//!  * Launch an asynchronous task to call the reactor's run() method.
//!
//! One you have a running channel, you can create circuits on it with
//! its [Channel::new_tunnel] method.  See
//! [crate::client::circuit::PendingClientTunnel] for information on how to
//! proceed from there.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! For now, this code splits the channel into two pieces: a "Channel"
//! object that can be used by circuits to write cells onto the
//! channel, and a "Reactor" object that runs as a task in the
//! background, to read channel cells and pass them to circuits as
//! appropriate.
//!
//! I'm not at all sure that's the best way to do that, but it's what
//! I could think of.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! TODO: There is no rate limiting or fairness.
