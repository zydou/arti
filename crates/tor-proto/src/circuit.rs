/// Description of the network's current rules for building circuits.
///
/// This type describes rules derived from the consensus,
/// and possibly amended by our own configuration.
///
/// Typically, this type created once for an entire circuit,
/// and any special per-hop information is derived
/// from each hop as a CircTarget.
/// Note however that callers _may_ provide different `CircParameters`
/// for different hops within a circuit if they have some reason to do so,
/// so we do not enforce that every hop in a circuit has the same `CircParameters`.

    // While flow control is a stream property and not a circuit property,
    // and it may seem better to pass the flow control parameters to for example `begin_stream()`,
    // it's included in [`CircParameters`] for the following reasons:
    //
    // - When endpoints (exits + hs) receive new stream requests, they need the flow control
    //   parameters immediately. It would be easy to pass flow control parameters when creating a
    //   stream, but it's not as easy to get flow control parameters when receiving a new stream
    //   request, unless those parameters are already available to the circuit (like
    //   `CircParameters` are).
    // - It's unclear if new streams on existing circuits should switch to new flow control
    //   parameters if the consensus changes. This behaviour doesn't appear to be specified. It
    //   might also leak information to the circuit's endpoint about when we downloaded new
    //   directory documents. So it seems best to stick with the same flow control parameters for
    //   the lifetime of the circuit.
    // - It doesn't belong in [`StreamParameters`] as `StreamParameters` is a set of preferences
    //   with defaults, and consensus parameters aren't preferences and don't have defaults.
    //   (Technically they have defaults, but `StreamParameters` isn't the place to set them.)
