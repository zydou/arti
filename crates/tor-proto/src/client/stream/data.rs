///
/// [`DataStream`] implements [`futures::io::AsyncRead`] and

/// traits are expected.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Connecting to an HTTP server and sending a request, using
/// [`AsyncWriteExt::write_all`](futures::io::AsyncWriteExt::write_all):
///
/// ```ignore
/// let mut stream = tor_client.connect(("icanhazip.com", 80), None).await?;

///
/// stream
///     .write_all(b"GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: icanhazip.com\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n")
///     .await?;
///
/// // Flushing the stream is important; see below!
/// stream.flush().await?;

///
/// If the `tokio` crate feature is enabled, this type also implements
/// [`tokio::io::AsyncRead`](tokio_crate::io::AsyncRead) and
/// [`tokio::io::AsyncWrite`](tokio_crate::io::AsyncWrite) for easier integration
/// with code that expects those traits.
///
/// # Remember to call `flush`!
///
/// DataStream buffers data internally, in order to write as few cells
/// as possible onto the network.  In order to make sure that your
/// data has actually been sent, you need to make sure that
/// [`AsyncWrite::poll_flush`] runs to completion: probably via
/// [`AsyncWriteExt::flush`](futures::io::AsyncWriteExt::flush).
///
/// # Splitting the type
///
/// This type is internally composed of a [`DataReader`] and a [`DataWriter`]; the
/// `DataStream::split` method can be used to split it into those two parts, for more
/// convenient usage with e.g. stream combinators.
///
/// # How long does a stream live?
///
/// A `DataStream` will live until all references to it are dropped,
/// or until it is closed explicitly.
///
/// If you split the stream into a `DataReader` and a `DataWriter`, it
/// will survive until _both_ are dropped, or until it is closed
/// explicitly.
///
/// A stream can also close because of a network error,
/// or because the other side of the stream decided to close it.
