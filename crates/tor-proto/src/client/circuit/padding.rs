//! Definitions for circuit padding.
//!
//! This module defines the API for a circuit padder, which is divided into two parts:
//! a [`PaddingController`] and [`PaddingEventStream`].
//!
//! When the `circ-padding` feature is enabled, the [`PaddingController`] is used
//! to tell a set of padding machines about incoming and outgoing
//! traffic to a circuit hop,
//! and the [`PaddingEventStream`] is used to decide when to send padding to that hop.
//!
//! When `circ-padding` is not enabled, both types are empty, and do nothing.
//!
//! # Padding event semantics
//!
//! Our events here are fairly tightly coupled
//! to the semantics provided by [`maybenot`].
//!
//! In brief, `maybenot` assumes:
//!   * That incoming traffic arrives on a queue,
//!     then is decrypted and sorted into "normal" and "padding".
//!   * That outgoing traffic (normal or padding) is placed onto a queue,
//!     and then eventually sent.
//!
//! For each of these cases, the circuit/tunnnel reactor
//! needs to call an appropriate method on [`PaddingController`]
//! to inform each hop's padding machines about the event.
//!
//! See the [`maybenot`] documentation for more information about when,
//! exactly, each method needs to be invoked.
//!
//! # Design considerations
//!
//! We expect that a substantial fraction of all circuit hops
//! will require padding in some form.
//! Because of this, we've taken some effort to optimize the
//! storage overhead of our padding state.
//!
