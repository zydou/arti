//! Module exposing the relay circuit reactor subsystem.
//!
//! The entry point of the reactor is [`RelayReactor::run`], which launches the
//! reactor background tasks, and begins listening for inbound cells on the provided
//! inbound Tor channel.
//!
//! ### Architecture
//!
//! Internally, the circuit reactor consists of two reactors, that run in separate tasks:
//!
//!   * [`ForwardReactor`]: handles exit-bound cells, by moving cells in the
//!     forward direction (from the client to the exit)
//!   * [`BackwardReactor`]: handles client-bound cells, by moving cells in the
//!     backward direction (from the exit to the client), and by packaging
//!     and sending application stream data towards the client
//!
//! The read and write ends of the inbound and outbound Tor channels are "split",
//! such that each reactor holds an `input` stream (for reading)
//! and a `chan_sender` sink (for writing):
//!
//!  * `ForwardReactor` holds the reading end of the inbound (coming from the client) Tor channel,
//!    and the writing end of the outbound (towards the exit) Tor channel, if there is one
//!  * `BackwardReactor` holds the reading end of the outbound channel, if there is one,
//!    and the writing end of the inbound channel, if there is one
//!
//! Upon receiving an unrecognized cell, the `ForwardReactor` forwards it towards the exit.
//! However, upon receiving a *recognized* cell, the `ForwardReactor` might need to
//! send that cell to the `BackwardReactor` for handling (for example, a cell
//! containing stream data needs to be delivered to the appropriate stream
//! in the `StreamMap`). For this, it uses the `cell_tx` MPSC channel.
//! This is needed because the read and write sides of `StreamMap` are not "splittable",
//! so we are stuck having to reroute all stream data to the reactor that owns the `StreamMap`
//! (i.e. to `BackwardReactor`). In the future, we'd like to redesign the `StreamMap`
//! to split the read ends of the streams from the write ones, which will enable us
//! to pass the read side to the `ForwardReactor` and the write side to the `BackwardReactor`.
//
// TODO(relay): the above is underspecified, because it's not implemented yet,
// but the plan is to iron out these details soon
//
//! This dual reactor architecture should, in theory, have better performance than
//! a single reactor system, because it enables us to parallelize some of the work:
//! the forward and backward directions share little state,
//! because they read from, and write to, different sinks/streams,
//! so they can be run in parallel (as separate tasks).
//! With a single reactor architecture, the reactor would need to drive
//! both the forward and the backward direction, and on each iteration
//! would need to decide which to prioritize, which might prove tricky
//! (though prioritizing one of them at random would've probably been good enough).
//!
//! The monolithic single reactor alternative would also have been significantly
//! more convoluted, and so more difficult to maintain in the long run.
//!
//
// Note: if we address the TODO below, the dual reactor architecture might even
// have some performance benefits:
//
// TODO: the part about sharing little state is not entirely accurate.
// Right now, they share the congestion control state, which is behind a mutex,
// and, indirectly, the `StreamMap` (via the `cell_tx` construction).
// In the future, we'd like to switch to a lock-less architecture,
// but that will involve redesign `CongestionControl`
// (to be mutable without &mut, for example by using atomics under the hood).
