//! Congestion control subsystem.
//!
//! This object is attached to a circuit hop (CircHop) and controls the logic for the congestion
//! control support of the Tor Network. It also manages the circuit level SENDME logic which is
//! part of congestion control.
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! The basics of this subsystem is that it is notified when a DATA cell is received or sent. This
//! in turn updates the congestion control state so that the very important
//! [`can_send`](CongestionControl::can_send) function be accurate to decide if a DATA cell can be
//! sent or not.
//!
//! Any part of the arti code that wants to send a DATA cell on the wire needs to call
//! [`can_send`](CongestionControl::can_send) before else we'll risk leaving the circuit in a
//! protocol violation state.
//!
//! Furthermore, as we receive and emit SENDMEs, it also has entry point for those two events in
//! order to update the state.
