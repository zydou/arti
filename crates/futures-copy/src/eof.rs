//! Support for defining behavior when encountering an EOF during
//! a bidirectional copy.
//!
//! When performing a bidirectional copy
//! with [`copy_bidirectional`](crate::copy_bidirectional)
//! or [`copy_buf_bidirectional`](crate::copy_buf_bidirectional),
//! it's sometimes the case that one side is done transmitting before the other is.
//! In this case, the caller needs to specify what will happen upon receiving an EOF
//! from each of the two streams.
//!
//! Typically, the caller wants to _propagate_ the EOF from the stream that has
//! given it to the other stream, by calling an operation like
//! [shutdown](std::net::TcpStream::shutdown) or
//! [close](futures::io::AsyncWriteExt::close).
//! But since multiple operations can be appropriate depending on the circumstances,
//! we define a [`EofStrategy`] trait that tells the bidirectional `copy` function
//! how to react.
