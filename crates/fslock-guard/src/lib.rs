///
///  * Only one `LockFileGuard` can exist at one time

/// # Restrictions
///
///  * **`path` must only be deleted (or renamed) via the APIs in this module**
///  * This restriction applies to all programs on the computer,
///    so for example automatic file cleaning with `find` and `rm` is forbidden.
///  * Cross-filesystem locking is broken on Linux before 2.6.12.

/// Platform module for locking protocol on Unix.
///
/// ### Locking protocol on Unix
///
/// The lock is held by an open-file iff:
///
///  * that open-file holds an `flock` `LOCK_EX` lock; and
///  * the directory entry for `path` refers to the same file as the open-file
///
/// `path` may only refer to a plain file, or `ENOENT`.
/// If `path` refers to a file,
/// only the lockholder may cause it to no longer refer to that file.
///
/// In principle the open-file might be shared with subprocesses.
/// Even a naive program can safely and correctly inherit and hold the lock,
/// since the lockholder only needs to not close an fd.
/// However uncontrolled leaking of the fd into other processes is undesirable,
/// as it might cause delays or even deadlocks, if those processes' inheritors live too long.
/// In our Rust implementation we don't support sharing the held lock
/// with subprocesses or different process images (ie across exec);
/// we use `O_CLOEXEC`.
///
/// #### Locking algorithm
///
///  1. open the file with `O_CREAT|O_RDWR`
///  2. `flock LOCK_EX`
///  3. `fstat` the open-file and `lstat` the path
///  4. If the inode and device numbers don't match,
///     close the fd and go back to the start.
///  5. Now we hold the lock.
///
/// Proof sketch:
///
/// If we get to point 5, we see that at point 3, we had the lock.
/// No-one else could cause the conditions to become false
/// in the meantime:
/// no-one else ~~can~~ may make `path` refer to a different file
/// since they don't hold the lock.
/// And, no-one else can `flock` it since the kernel prevents
/// a conflicting lock.
/// So at step 5 we must still hold the lock.
///
/// #### Unlocking algorithm
///
///  1. Close the fd.
///  2. Now we no longer hold the lock and others can acquire it.
///
/// This drops the open-file and
/// leaves the lock available for another caller.
///
/// #### Deletion algorithm
///
///  0. The lock must already be held
///  1. `unlink` the file
///  2. close the fd
///  3. Now we no longer hold the lock and others can acquire it.
///
/// Step 1 atomically falsifies the lock-holding condition.
/// We are allowed to perform it because we hold the lock.
///
/// Concurrent lockers might open the old file,
/// which we are about to delete.
/// They will acquire their `flock` (locking step 2)
/// after we close (deletion step 2)
/// and then see that they have a stale file.

/// Platform module for locking protocol on Windows.
///
/// The argument for correctness on Windows proceeds as for Unix, but with a
/// higher degree of uncertainty, since we are not sufficient Windows experts to
/// determine if our assumptions hold.
///
/// Here we assume as follows:
/// * When `fslock` calls `CreateFileW`, it gets a `HANDLE` to an open file.
///   As we use them, the `HANDLE` behaves
///   similarly to the "fd" in the Unix argument above,
///   and the open file behaves similarly to the "open-file".
///   * We assume that any differences that exist in their behavior do not
///     affect our correctness above.
/// * When `fslock` calls `LockFileEx`, and it completes successfully,
///   we now have a lock on the file.
///   Only one lock can exist on a file at a time.
/// * When we compare members of `handle.metadata()` and `path.metadata()`,
///   the comparison will return equal if ~~and only if~~
///   the two files are truly the same.
///   * We rely on the property that a file cannot change its file_index while it is
///     open.
/// * Deleting the lock file will actually work, since `fslock` opened it with
///   FILE_SHARE_DELETE.
/// * When we delete the lock file, possibly-asynchronous ("deferred") deletion
///   definitely won't mean that the OS kernel violates our rule that no-one but the lockholder
///   is allowed to delete the file.
/// * The above is true even if someone with read
///   access to the file - eg the human user - opens it without the FILE_SHARE options.
/// * The same is true even if there is a virus scanner.
/// * The same is true even on a remote filesystem.
/// * If someone with read access to the file - eg the human user - opens it for reading
///   without FILE_SHARE options, the algorithm will still work and not fail
///   with a file sharing violation io error.
///   (Or, every program the user might use to randomly peer at files in arti's
///   state directory, including the equivalents of `grep -R` and backup programs,
///   will use suitable FILE_SHARE options.)
///   (If this assumption is false, the consequence is not data loss;
///   rather, arti would fall over.  So that would be tolerable if we don't
///   know how to do better, or if doing better is hard.)
