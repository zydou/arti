# By default we'd like to get good performance and a small download size.
# (Assuming xz compression on the binary.)
#
# The biggest win is to run `strip --strip-debug` on the binary after
# generating it, to throw out debugging symbols that we inherited from
# other libraries.  Don't do `strip --strip-unused`, though, or you'll
# break backtraces.  That saves about 21% download size.

# Using LTO saves a further 14% of download size, and improves performance,
# at the cost of compile time.
