# Documentation for Arti (dev branch)

DocumentWrite is working on a documentation for the Arti project. Start date is August 1st and the project will go until November.

The two deliverables of this project will be:

- content and UX audit report
- new Arti documentation

## About the project

This project is built with Docusaurus, a modern static site generator, and is still in progress.

## How to run the project locally

To run this project locally, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once you have Node.js installed, you can clone this repository and run the following commands:

```
cd arti-doc-project-2023
npm install
npm run start
```

This will start a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
