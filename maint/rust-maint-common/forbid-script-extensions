#
# This is a very common antipattern.  Almost, dominant.  But it's bad.
# It means call sites (including maybe out-of-tree) and human habits
# must change if the script is rewritten in a different language.
#
# This rule only applies to *executable* files, which can be invoked
# by their name.  Script modules or fragments which are to be included
# are fine, since their language is part of their API.
#
# Exceptions are supported, by passing !<FILENAME> or !<GLOB> as argument(s).
