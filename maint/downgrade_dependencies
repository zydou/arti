# Downgrades every one of our dependencies in Cargo.lock to the

# supported by our first-order dependencies in their oldest versions.)

# The purpose of this script is to make sure that we are actually
# compatible with the versions listed in our Cargo.toml files.
# Without testing this, we could wind up with code that built
# successfully with the versions listed in Cargo.lock, while declaring
# support for versions of our dependencies that won't actually work.
