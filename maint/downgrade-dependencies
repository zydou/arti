# Downgrades every one of our dependencies in Cargo.lock to the
# earliest version listed in our Cargo.toml files.  (And then
# re-upgrades a few second-order dependencies that aren't actually
# supported by our first-order dependencies in their oldest versions.)
#
# If running this script causes a build failure that can be fixed by adding a
# exception, go ahead and add the exception. In the long term, we should switch
# to --direct-minimal-versions, which should not require any exceptions, but it
# will take some work to get that to work - see arti#2032.
#
# The purpose of this script is to make sure that we are actually
# compatible with the versions listed in our Cargo.toml files.
# Without testing this, we could wind up with code that built
# successfully with the versions listed in Cargo.lock, while declaring
# support for versions of our dependencies that won't actually work.
