### Notes

This file describes changes in Arti through the current release.  Once Arti
is more mature, we may switch to using a separate changelog for each crate.

# Arti 1.6.0 â€” 2 October 2025

Arti 1.6.0 brings experimental support for [circuit padding][circuit-padding.md],
[mitigations for DropMark side channel attacks][prop349],
improvements to congestion control,
a new `arti keys check-integrity` command,
and [experimental support][otel-docs] for exporting debugging information via [OpenTelemetry],

It also includes behind-the-scenes work towards enabling Arti to act as a directory authority, a directory mirror, and a relay.

Arti 1.6.0 increases our MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version)
to 1.85.1, in accordance with our [MSRV policy].

As usual, there are also various under-the-hood improvements and bug fixes,
which are documented below.

### Breaking changes

* Increased MSRV from 1.85 to 1.85.1 ([!3240])

### Security fixes

* Arti now requires `tracing-subscriber` v0.3.20,
  due to upstream security issue [RUSTSEC-2025-0055].
  It is unlikely that this would have been exploitable in Arti running with the default configuration,
  but a detailed analysis was not performed. ([!3221])

### Major features

* Arti now includes experimental circuit padding support, based on the [`maybenot`] library.
  When the `circ-padding-manual` feature is enabled on the `tor-proto` crate,
  researchers can now install one or more randomized padding machines on each hop of the circuit to send and receive padding.
  Once this defense is correctly tuned, it will help resist traffic and protocol fingerprinting attacks.
  For more information, see the [design document][circuit-padding.md].
  ([!3185], [!3225], [!3276], [!3222], [!3228], [!3237], [!3241], [!3260], [!3242], [!3246], [!3252], [!3261], [!3262], [!3271], [!3292], [!3293])
* Arti now has mitigations for DropMark side-channel attacks for flow control,
  as described in [Proposal 349][prop349].
  The flow control feature is experimental,
  and can be enabled with the `flowctl-cc` feature flag). ([!3266], [!3181])
* Arti now has a `arti keys check-integrity` command, to check the validity of stored keys. ([!3161])
* Arti now has experimental support for exporting debugging information via [OpenTelemetry].
  Due to the potentially sensitive nature of this information,
  we only recommend using this for debugging and development purposes.
  It can be enabled with the `opentelemetry` feature flag,
  and [documentation on how to use it][otel-docs] is available. ([!3239])

### Deprecated functionality

* In `tor-netdoc`, deprecated the `dangerous-expose-struct-fields` feature, making fields always pub. ([!3299])

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

#### `tor-dirmgr`

* Moved `Authority`, `AuthorityBuilder`, `DownloadScheduleConfigBuilder`, `DownloadScheduleBuilder`, `DownloadScheduleConfig`, `DirToleranceBuilder`, `NetworkConfigBuilder`, `DownloadSchedule`, `DirTolerance`, `config::NetworkConfig`, and related items to the new `tor-dircommon` crate. ([!3238])

#### `tor-guardmgr`

* Moved `FallbackList`, `FallbackDir`, `FallbackListBuilder`, and `FallbackDirBuilder` to the new `tor-dircommon` crate. ([!3245])

#### `tor-hscrypto`

* `derive-deftly` is no longer optional, thus no longer exists as a feature. ([!3268])

#### `tor-llcrypto`

* Renamed `pk::rsa::PrivateKey` to `pk::rsa::KeyPair`. ([!3236])
* `derive-deftly` is no longer optional, thus no longer exists as a feature. ([!3268])

#### `tor-proto`

* Renamed `channel::launch()` to `channel::launch_client()`. ([!3158])
* Added new `FlowCtrlParameters` parameter to `CircParameters::new()`. ([!3249])
* Added new `Arc<dyn TimeoutEstimator>` parameter to `PendingClientTunnel::new` and `Channel::new_tunnel`. ([!3267])

#### `tor-units`

* `BoundedInt32` now checks that `LOWER <= HIGHER` at build time instead of run time. ([!3247])
* Removed unused `Error::Uninhabited` variant. ([!3247])

### Relay development

* Refactored channel handshake code. ([!3182])
* Added support for legacy RSA keys to `tor-key-forge`. ([!3236])

### Directory authority development

* Created new `tor-dircommon` crate for shared implementation of the directory specification. ([!3205])
* Created new `tor-dirserver` crate for implementation of a directory authority and directory mirror servers. ([!3192])
* Added support for [Proposal 330](https://spec.torproject.org/proposals/330-authority-contact.html) for storing `DirPort`s. ([!3244])

### Congestion control

* Fixed bug in congestion control that was causing timeouts when `flowctl-cc` was enabled. ([!3223])
* Added support for flow control consensus params. ([!3249], [!3263])
* Refactored flow control code. ([!3243], [!3273], [!3280])
* Changed default `cc_alg` from none to vegas congestion control. ([!3248])
* Fixed a warning when building without `flowctl-cc`. ([!3272])

### Testing

* Added integration tests for `arti hss ctor-migrate`. ([!3216])
* Fixed `arti keys` integration test to work on case-insensitive filesystems. ([!3209])
* Reduced flakiness of shadow tests. ([!3227])
* Increased chutney test-transfer sizes to 5MB. ([!3047])
* Pinned CI to use `cargo-sort` v2.0.1 due to changes in formatting in v2.0.2. ([!3232])
* Refactored chutney CI scripts. ([!3264])
* Fixed Python lints and made them required to pass in CI. ([!3265])
* Removed `--verbose` from cargo flags in CI. ([!3234])

### Documentation

* Improved `arti hsc` key management documentation. ([!3256])
* Documented `arti hsc --batch` flag. ([!3215])
* Added note to READMEs about bug in `native-tls` on MacOS, which should not affect our crates. ([!3297])
* Begun creating security response documentation. ([!3233])
* Improved release documentation. ([!3211], [!3304], [!3306])
* Documented why `resolver` entry is needed in `Cargo.toml`. ([!3202])

### Infrastructure

* Removed `maint/check_doc_features` and use of `doc_auto_cfg`, due to improvements landing in Rust that render them unnecessary. ([!3294])
* Added `maint/check_case_sensitive` to check for filenames that differ only by case. ([!3207])
* Added a `flake.nix` file for building Arti in a Nix environment. ([!3275])

# Arti 1.5.0 â€” 28 August 2025

Arti 1.5.0 continues development on important client features,
including [Counter Galois Onion][cgo] encryption,
[Conflux], [flow control and congestion control][flowctl-cc],
and onion service [proof of work][prop362].
It also includes significant preliminary work for Arti relay support.

Additionally, this release [mitigates][!3141] a [longstanding bug][#2079]
that could prevent Arti clients from bootstrapping.

Arti 1.5.0 increases our MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version)
to 1.85, in accordance with our [MSRV policy].

As usual, there are also various under-the-hood improvements and bug fixes,
which are documented below.

### Breaking changes

- Arti now requires Rust 1.85 or later. ([#2095], [!3128], [!3145])

### Major bugfixes

- We no longer count channel negotiation time against our circuit timeouts.
  This may help avoid [a bug][#2079] where Arti would think that all of its
  guards were failing due to a mismatch in expected circuit
  construction times. ([!3141])

### Major features (experimental)

- `tor-proto` now includes experimental backend support (unused, so far) for
  [Conflux]-based multi-path tunnels, for improved performance and
  resiliency. ([!3082])
- Experimental support for [congestion control][flowctl-cc] for improved
  performance.  This is not yet enabled by default, while we perform more
  testing and resolve [pending issues][#2130].
  ([!3113], [!3118], [!3131], [!3197])
- Experimental support for [proof-of-work][prop362] in onion services,
  for resistance to denial-of-service attacks. ([!3106], [!3132])
- Experimental support for negotiating [Counter Galois Onion][cgo]
  cryptography with versions of Tor that support it.
  ([!3133], [prop359])
- Arti now has experimental, incomplete support for the [`smol`] async runtime.
  It is an improved replacement for [`async-std`], which will soon be
  deprecated in Arti.  We still recommend the [`tokio`] runtime for most users.
  ([!2986], [!3194])

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- Refactor `tor-proto` APIs to focus on _tunnels_ rather than circuits.
  A tunnel may be either a Conflux multi-path bundle, or a single circuit.
  A tunnel no longer has a _single_ path, but rather a collection of paths.
  ([!3082])
- Major API changes to consensus parsing and access APIs and types in
  `tor-netdoc`. ([!3139], [!3164], [!3172])
- Refactor some client-specific `tor-proto` APIs to have client-related names.
  ([ebb97da7a209af06])
- Move most functionality from `tor-proto::circuit` and `tor-proto::stream`
  into `tor-proto::client`.
  ([1ee26f2168ee2ded], [702e7276898d3f31], [!3193])
- In `tor-cell`, remove the never-implemented `AUTHORIZE` cell type. ([8e9e5a2f6ff2036])
- In `tor-cell`, remove the `ProofOfWorkV1::cap_effort()` method. ([eabd0c0bfe70333])
- In `tor-chanmgr`, the `ChanBuilder::new()` API now takes an optional
  key-manager argument. ([a187a2fef281d7da])
- In `tor-circmgr`, the `get_or_launch_specific` API has been replaced with
  tunnel-specific type launcher APIs, and
  `CircuitBuilder` has been replaced with `TunnelBuilder`.
  ([8333a2d7c9e48427])
- In `tor-dirclient`, `SourceInfo::from_circuit` has been renamed to
  `from_tunnel`. ([f89c0b38df232e5c8aa])
- In `tor-hsclient`, `get_or_launch_circuit` has been renamed to
  `get_or_launch_tunnel`, and the deprecated `get_or_launch_connection`
  alias has been removed. ([8333a2d7c9e48427])

### Key manager development

- Improved CLI output when describing keys. ([!3116], [!3143])
- Design for a new key integrity checking subcommand. ([!3126])
- Integration testing for `arti keys` subcommands. ([!3166])

### Relay development

- Design work for a relay reactor backend. ([!3146])
- Placeholder sketch implementation for a relay backend in `tor-proto`.
  ([!3162])
- Major refactoring to channel cell types and handling to prepare
  for relay channel authentication. ([!3158], [!3173], [!3178], [!3198])
- Revise `tor-proto` code to match correct behaviors with respect to
  channel negotiation cells. ([!3174], [!3184])

### Directory authority development

- Work on a new netdoc parser implementation for improved ergonomics
  and macro support.
  We'll use this to parse and generate vote documents, and eventually
  more types of object. ([!3135], [!3180])
- Refactor handling of different network-status types and flavors
  (now collectively called "variants"), for better interaction
  with future directory authority code.
  ([!3139], [!3164], [!3172])

### Testing

- Clean up documentation and implementation for time-mocking.
  ([!3150])
- Add tests for `create_unbootstrapped_async()`. ([#2121], [!3167])

### Documentation

- Describe in-progress changes to our code submission process
  as we deal with the effects of moving to a new flavor of Gitlab.
  ([!3121])
- Document why you should use `-p arti` when building arti.
  ([!3134])
- Several cleanups to website documentation for style and accuracy.
  ([!3109])
- Several cleanups to README.md for style and accuracy. ([!3115])
- Fix comments in `ChannelCodec::encode`. ([!3155])
- Document that memory tracking does not cover _all_ memory usage.
  ([#2102], [!3165])
- Internal documentation for `CC_XOFF_CLIENT` behavior. ([!3156])
- Document license rationale for using `ring` rather than `aws-lc` with
  `rustls`. ([!3170], [!3176])
- Fix a link in Release.md. ([!3190])
- Document how various protocol state machine rules in Arti are enforced.
  ([prop349], [!3171])

### Infrastructure

- Use a new version of [Chutney] in our CI, to get support for testing
  onion services with Arti. ([bb3a2c99db37271e])
- Tweak [Shadow] settings to avoid a flood of bug warnings from C Tor.
  ([9289c00cb5a97943])
- Adjust [Chutney] scripts and settings to bootstrap more cleanly,
  with fewer warnings. ([!3149])
- New script to generate a checklist for release tasks. ([!3125])
- Replace dependency proxy with pull-through cache for improved
  docker image rate-limiting in CI. ([!3175])
- Use Rust 1.89 as our "recent" Rust image in CI. ([!3147])
- Update minimum CI artifact lifetime to 1 day. ([#2064], [!3098])
- Use the "quicktest" profile for integration testing.
  What it costs in build time, it should save in runtime. ([!3157])
- Refactor how our `check_licenses` script handles per-crate
  exceptions. ([!3195])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

- Fix several warnings when compiling for Windows. ([!3114], [!3179])
- Do not enable needless experimental features when building
  the `obsf4-checker` example. ([a2d06cf94f2d0907])
- Fix a comment format issue that was confusing vim. ([!3136])
- Upgrade our codebase to the [2024 edition] of Rust.
  ([#2101], [!3137])
- Use several new features available with Rust 1.85.
  ([#2135], [!3129], [!3138], [!3183])
- Log errors with more report information in circuit reactors.
  ([#2057], [!3122])
- Use a newer version of [`slab`] to avoid a RUSTSEC warning.
  ([!3151])
- Refactor tunnel reactor to consolidate calls to `send_unbounded`.
  ([!3154])
- Remove outdated TODOs in `tor-hsservice`. ([bc5b3130283f0699])
- Fix several new warnings and errors from nightly Rust.
  ([#2124], [!3148], [!3169])
- Allow our error-handling log macros (`warn_report!`, `info_report!`, etc)
  to use fields in `tracing` messages. ([#2096], [#2116], [!3142])
- Fix a few python linter warnings. ([!3168], [!3147])
- Change format of redacted onion service IDs from `???xyz.onion`
  to `[â€¦]xyz.onion`. ([#2126], [!3177])
- Distinguish RPC object identity types through a more sensible system.
  ([!3191])
- The "quicktest" profile now builds more quickly,
  but produces less optimized binaries.
  It still occupies a space between "dev" and "release".
  ([4b9b53541feb8bb0])
- Add more logs about timeout estimation and connection failures. ([!3152])

### Examples

- New example showing how to use Arti as a custom
  connector for use with [`hyper`]. ([49fab4945e515dc9])
- Numerous fixes and revisions to other [`hyper`] examples. ([!2941])

# Arti 1.4.6 â€” 4 August 2025

Arti 1.4.6 continues development on xon-based ([Proposal 324]) flow
control, [Conflux], and improved cryptography (CGO,. ([Proposal 359])

Arti 1.4.6 also contains two improvements to help resist two different
kinds of denial-of-service attack, relating to Hidden Services, and
some other bugfixes.  Especially, users who operate `.onion` services
are advised to upgrade.

(There's significant work ongoing on Arti Relay, but that is currently
occurring outside of the Arti mainline so has not landed in in 1.4.6.)

### Breaking changes

#### Developer-facing

- `tor_memquota::ConfigBuilder::max()` and `ConfigBuilder::low_water()`
  now take a `impl Into<ExplicitOrAuto<usize>>` instead of a `usize`.
  This should generally be backwards compatible, but may cause type inference errors.
  (These types are effectively part of the public API of `arti-client`.)
  ([!3110])
- In `arti-ureq`, `PreferredRuntime`-using `ConnectorBuilder`
  constructors are now associated functions on `ConnectorBuilder<PreferredRuntime>`
  rather than (anomalously) `ConnectorBuilder<impl Runtime>`.
  (The return types haven't changed.)
  ([!3101])

### Security fixes

- Replace the Hidden Service (.onion service) Proof of Work control loop.
  Improves denial of service resistance.
  ([Proposal 362], [!3093], no TROVE.)
- Limit hidden service descriptor size inflation.
  ([Proposal 360], [torspec!411], [#2046], [!3070], no TROVE.)

### Major bugfixes

- Fix spurious 0-length buffer read in `DataReader`.
  This bug caused some client programs to experience truncated streams, losing data.
  ([!3080], [#2053])

### Major features

- New experimental `arti hss ctor-migrate` command line invocation
  for migrating a hidden serivce (`.onion` service) identity key
  from C Tor to an Arti keystore.
  ([!3102])
- Enable the memquota (memory use control) system by default.
  (Part of congestion control work.)
  ([!3110], [#2030])

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- `tor-cell`: `UnparsedRelayMsg::data_len()` now returns a `Result`.
  ([!3094])
- `tor-hscrypto`: `HsID` no longer implements `LowerHex` or `Display`.
  ([!3107])
- `tor-keymgr`: `UnrecognizedEntryError::new` no longer exposed;
  `UnrecognizedEntryId` renamed to `UnrecognizedEntry`;
  `KeyMgr::list()` and `Keystore::list()` return types changed.
  ([!3059])

### Development progress

#### Conflux

- Add tests for client-side SWITCH handling.
  ([!3091])
- Preparatory work for replacing the `tor-proto` circuit reactor:
  Add a `ConfluxSet::remove_unchecked` method.
  ([!3105], [#1803])

#### Congestion control

- Code for handling XON/XOFF messages in `tor-proto` and `tor-cell`.
  ([!3054], [!3094], [!3099])
- `tor-cell`: Exposed flow-control related types.
  (Previously these were behind the experimental 'flowctl-cc' feature,
  which is removed in this release.)

#### CGO (Counter Galois Onion - improved crpytography)

- Implementation of CGO negotiation and use, in `tor-proto`.
  Not yet usable.
  ([Proposal 359], [!3069], [#1947], [#1945])

### Testing

- Update shadow, mostly to get reproducibility fixes.
  ([!3092], [shadow#3610])
- Pin `cargo-licence` to 0.7.0, and update our allows to match its output.
  ([!3108], [#2083], [!3111])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

#### User-facing

- Provide experimental `arti keys-raw remove-by-id` command line function.
  ([!3059], [!3095])

#### Developer-facing

- Re-export `ConfigurationSources` from the `arti_client` crate.
  ([!3044])
- `safelog`: New `DisplayRedacted`/`DebugRedacted` APIs
  to help avoid accidentally redacting, corrupting, or exposing,
  hidden service identities (`.onion` names).
  ([!3107], [!3071], [#2012], [#2066])
- Fix documentation for macros in `tor_hscrypto::pk`.
  ([#2050], [!3104])
- Many typo fixes.
  ([!3090], [!3089])

#### Internal and administrative

- Introduce a new internal error type `KeystoreNotConfigured`,
  for improved clarity and less confusion in keystore error handling.
  ([!3103])
- Update an internal TODO about `NonZero`.
  ([!3067], [rust-lang/rust#142966])
- Remove some unnecessary parens in the code.
  ([!3096])
- Update dependencies.
  ([!3073], [!3117])

# Arti 1.4.5 â€” 7 July 2025

Arti 1.4.5 continues development on xon-based ([proposal 324]) flow control and
[Conflux]. In addition, we have drafted an initial design for the directory
cache storage model, which will be needed for the core relay functionality, and
for the directory authority implementation.

As usual, there are also various under-the-hood improvements and bug fixes,
which are documented below.

### Breaking changes

- Console logging now goes to stderr instead of stdout. ([#2024], [!3020])

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- In `tor-proto`, `CongestionParams::use_fallback_alg()` is no longer public.
- In `tor-proto`, `ClientCirc::extend_virtual()` now takes parameters by reference,
  and a list of Protocol capabilities.
- The `once-cell` feature was removed from `fs-mistrust`.
- In `tor-netdir`, the `FromInt32Saturating` trait has an extra `from_checked`
  function.

### Onion service development

- Decreased the minimum allowed duration of the `hsdir_interval` to 5 minutes,
  according to the changes from [torspec!406]. ([!3042])
- New experimental `arti keys list` and `arti keys list-keystores` subcommands
  for listing the existing keys and configured keystores.
  ([#2043], [!3023], [!3060])

### Relay development

- Design notes for the storage model of the directory cache. ([!3017])

### Proposal 324 flow control development

- `DataWriter` is now rate-limited.  For now, the rate is set very high (`u64::MAX`),
  but in the future it will be dynamically changed as we receive XON/XOFF signals.
  ([#1992], [!3014], [!3029], [!3033])
- Added experimental support for XON/XOFF cells,
  gated behind the `flowctl-cc` feature. ([!3031], [!3061])
- Add a new async notification channel that will be used in the flow control
  implementation. ([!3066])

### Conflux development

- Updated conflux implementation to validate the congestion control algorithm used
  by the join point hop. ([!3046])
- Tunnels now have unique identifiers, which are distinct from the identifiers
  of their underlying circuits. ([!3048], [!3050])
- The conflux implementation now uses the circuit `UniqId` to identify circuits.
  ([#1999], [!3053])
- Fixed bug causing the circuits in a conflux tunnel to have disjoint stream maps.
  ([#2011], [!3034])
- Fixed a variety of conflux-related bugs that prevented the handshake from
  completing successfully. ([!3034])
- Addressed several small conflux-related TODOs and typos. ([!3045], [!3065])
- Removed all uses of `HopNum` outside of `tor-proto`. ([!3075])
- Fixed a bug causing multipath tunnels to send cells in violation of congestion
  control. ([04754e99b8e5899bdb0a6511b486001905dea503]])
- Fixed an off-by-one error which caused unnecessary leg switching when all
  circuits in a multipath tunnel had the same, equally "best" RTT. ([712785e00911543030871d6360fc3c6eeb5b33b5])
- Fixed a conflux sequence number accounting bug. ([e675585b9e8ecff1ccf097e3be320631253816d8])
- Added tests for conflux stream management. ([!3034], [!3077])

### Internal cleanup and refactoring
- `NetDir::pick_n_relays` no longer logs an unnecessary warning
  if there are fewer usable relays than requested. ([!3028])
- Removed `tor-rtcompat`'s `rustls` dependency in favor of `futures-rustls`.
  ([!2943])
- Refactored `CircParameters` to use a different type for representing
  the negotiated settings, and to simplify usage. ([#1967], [#1968], [!3021])
- In `tor-proto`, the `CircHop` internals are now private. ([[!3034]])

### Other user-facing improvements

- Experimental support for launching a SOCKS proxy from a set of already
  bound listeners. ([!3016])

### Testing

- Made the `tor-proto` benchmarks compile on non-x86 architectures too.
  ([#2029], [!3032])
- `MockExecutor::spawn_blocking` now uses `subthread_spawn` instead of
  `spawn_identified`. ([#2033], [!3036])

### Documentation

- Removed inaccurate doc comment saying consensus diffs are not supported.
  ([!3039])
- Clarified the drop behavior of `Blocking::spawn_blocking`. ([!3062])
- Fixed various typos in the README. ([!3078])

### Infrastructure

- CI now uses an updated version of [Chutney] that has native support
  for Arti nodes. ([!3009])
- CI no longer uses a pinned nightly Rust version.
  ([#2018], [!3035])
- In the Shadow integration tests, Arti processes now log to file instead of console.
  ([!3020])
- The Android builds are now reproducible. ([!3055])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

  ([#1647], [!3037])
- Upgraded to `hickory-proto` version 0.25.2. ([#1962], [!3038])
- Upgraded to `rusqlite` version 0.36.0. ([!3041])
- Removed the `once_cell` dependency from various crates. ([!3051])
- In `tor-netdir`, we now log any unexpected or invalid network parameters.
  ([!3043])
- Replaced a runtime key length check with a compile-time check
  in `tor-proto`. ([!3068])
- Updated the `RttEstimator` logic to set all initial estimates to `None` instead of
  `0`, and to report a minimum/EWMA RTT of `u32::MAX` if there are no measurements.
  ([#2049], [!3074])
- The `RttEstimator` now has a handle to the `DynTimeProvider` of the circuit,
  to support mocking the time in tests. ([!3063])
- Improved the log messages about rejecting relays. ([#2006], [!3072])
- Reworked the `tor-proto` `StreamReader` into a `futures::Stream`. ([!3076])
- Fixed various new clippy warnings in Rust 1.88. ([!3081])

# Arti 1.4.3 â€” 1 May 2025

Arti 1.4.3 adds adds the framework for measuring metrics
(which will be used to allow service and relay operators to use Prometheus
or similar tools to monitor the health of their services),
initial groundwork for the [Counter Galois Onion proposal][cgo],
and some of the groundwork for congestion control, in the form of handshake negotiation code.

We are also publishing the new `arti-ureq` crate,
which allows Arti to be used with the Rust `ureq` library for making HTTP request via Tor.

As usual, there are also many under-the-hood improvements and fixes,
which are documented in detail below.

### Breaking changes

* The `arti hsc` flags `--quiet` and `--force` have been consolidated into a single `--batch` flag. ([!2903])

### Major bugfixes

* Arti now exits by default when it does not support a recommended or required protocol. ([!2929])

### Major features

* Arti now has a initial framework for collecting metrics, which will be used
  to allow service and relay operators to monitor their services with
  Prometheus or compatible tools. ([!2918])
* Added initial groundwork for [Counter Galois Onion encryption][cgo]. ([!2940], [!2942])
* Arti now has support for congestion control handshake negotiation. Congestion
  control is not yet fully supported, but this lays the groundwork. ([!2932])
* Created the `arti-ureq` library to allow using Arti with the Rust HTTP
  library [ureq](https://crates.io/crates/ureq). Examples are [available in the
  `examples/ureq-examples`
  directory](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/tree/main/examples/ureq-examples?ref_type=heads). ([!2724])

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

* `tor-cell`: Removed deprecated method `Data::split_from()`.
* `tor-cell`: `Data::try_split_from()` now expects a cell format argument.
* `tor-cell`: `RelayMsgOuter::encode()` now expects a cell format argument.
* `tor-circmgr`, `tor-proto`: Removed `ntor_v3` feature flag. This feature is now always enabled. ([!2907])
* `tor-config`: Added `Listen::single_address_legacy`.
* `tor-keymgr`: `Keystore::insert` now uses param `key: &dyn EncodableItem` to obtain a `KeystoreItemType`,
  instead of `item_type` param. ([!2902])
* `tor-netdir`: Added `protocol_statuses()` method on `NetDirProvider` trait.
* `tor-protover`: Renamed `MicroDesc` protocol to `Microdesc` for spec conformance.
* `tor-rtcompat`: `BlockOn::reenter_block_on` accepts a non-`Send`, non-`'static` future.
* `tor-rtmock`: `MockExecutor::subthread_block_on` accepts a non-`Send`, non-`'static` future.

### Testing

* Added test case for `arti::onion_proxy::build_list`. ([!2896])

### Documentation

* Removed references to `rpc_demo.py`, which has been deleted. ([!2913])
* Cleaned up contributing info in README. ([!2889])
* Replaced outdated references to `KeystoreSweeper`. ([!2936])
* Added a policy forbidding forking after `exec`. ([!2925])
* Fixed intra-doc backlinks in `hashx` and `tor-persist` crates. ([!2944])
* Removed incorrect note about `StateDirectory` usage. ([!2952])
* Documented conventions around logging. ([!2966])
* Fixed some typos. ([!2961])

### Infrastructure

* Improved reproducibility of shadow E2E tests. ([!2905], [!2950], [!2958])
* Shadow now captures smaller pcaps. ([!2916])
* Removed `cargo build` step from chutney setup. ([!2947])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

* Added Python files to `.gitignore`. ([!2914])
* `tor-keymgr` now validates ephemeral types. ([!2917])
* Removed several outdated TODOs. ([!2900])
* Improved Debian packaging. ([!2927])
* Fixed warnings on Rust 1.86. ([!2920], [!2933])
* Updated dependencies. ([!2924], [!2931], [!2969], [!2970], [!2973], [!2974])
* Refactored `get_hs_client_secret_keys_desc_enc_only` to avoid code duplication. ([!2900])
* Tweaked Conflux APIs. ([!2928])
* `tor-rtmock` now allows non `Send + 'static` futures in for `BlockOn::reenter_block_on`. ([!2934])
* Fixed Android builds. ([!2824])
* Added `ErrorDetail::OnionServiceSetup` to handle previously-unhandled error during onion service setup. ([!2923])
* Stop panicking on non-existent hop number in `send_relay_cell`. ([!2938])
* Started migrating from `once_cell` crate to `std::sync::OnceLock`. ([!2948])
* Cleaned up TODOs related to MSRV. ([!2945])
* Prevent congestion control extension during ntor-v3 extend. ([!2957])
* Optimize for performance in release builds, instead of size. ([!2959])
* Added script to check for wildcard dependencies. ([!2954])
* Added `UnparsedRelayMsg::data_len` to `tor-cell`. ([!2976])

# Arti 1.4.2 â€” 31 March 2025

Arti 1.4.2 marks a significant milestone: Arti's RPC subsystem is now stable
and ready for use!

This release continues development on [Conflux],
and also fixes a number of bugs and security issues.

Arti 1.4.2 contains many breaking changes in our lower level crates;
please see below.

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- Many APIs now expect `rand` version 0.9. ([!2869])
- The obsolete `tor-congestion` crate is no longer being published.
  ([#1864], [!2828])
- In `tor-llcrypto`, `curve25519` and `ed25519` types are now wrappers,
  with slight API changes. ([!2868])
- In `tor-config-path`, `CfgAddrError::ConstructUnixAddress` and
  `CfgAddrError::NoUnixAddressSupport` are renamed
  to `ConstructAfUnixAddress` and `NoAfUnixSocketSupport`, respectively.
  No change to the semantics, just corrected terminology.
  We have removed the old variants so that any code which actively matches
  on this variant won't be silently broken.
  ([#827], [!2841])
- In `tor-general-addr`, `AddrParseError::InvalidUnixAddress` is renamed
  to `InvalidAfUnixAddress`.
  No change to the semantics, just corrected terminology.
  We have removed the old variant so that any code which actively matches
  on this variant won't be silently broken.
  ([#827], [!2841])
- In `tor-rpc-connect`, `ConnectError::UnixAddressAccess` is renamed
  to `AfUnixSocketPathAccess`.
  No change to the semantics, just corrected terminology.
  We have removed the old variant so that any code which actively matches
  on this variant won't be silently broken.
  ([#827], [!2841])
- In `tor-rpc-connect`, removed `ConnectError::InvalidUnixAddress`.
  This error was misnamed, had a description which didn't correspond to
  its name, and was in any case never generated.
  ([#827], [!2841])
- In `tor-key-forge`, keys can now only be generated with an `EntropicRng`.
  ([#1898], [!2874])
- In `tor-netdoc`, the following APIs now return a `Result`:
  `RouterReader::new()`, `MicrodescReader::new()`, `AuthCert::parse_multiple()`.
  ([!2866])
- In `tor-proto`, the functions for constructing padding parameters are now fallible.
  ([!2869])
- In `tor-rtcompat`, the `BlockOn` trait was split into `ToplevelBlockOn` and `Blocking`.
  New rules for `BlockOn::block_on`; when `ToplevelBlockOn` not
  available, use methods from `Blocking` instead.  Documentation explains.
  ([#1835], [!2810])

### Security fixes

- Upgraded to `ring` version 0.17.13. ([!2847])
- Upgraded to `rand` version 0.9.0.
  ([#1774], [!2869], [#1902], [!2877], [#1903], [!2880])
- Longer-lived keys are now derived using a `CautiousRng`,
  which combines inputs from several sources,
  including `OsRng`, to minimize the likelihood of falling
  to a vulnerability in any particular one. ([#1898], [!2874])

### Network updates

- Updated to the latest list of Tor fallback directories. ([!2875])

### Major bugfixes

- Arti now imposes a maximum on its fallback estimated timeout,
  to prevent integer overflow. ([#1693], [!2842])

### Deprecated functionality

- In `tor-rtmock`, `MockSleepProvider` and `MockSleepRuntime` are now deprecated.
  These have known bugs (e.g. [#1036]) and can make it easy to write flaky tests.
  They have been documented as deprecated since `tor-rtmock` 0.11.0 in
  October 2023.  Now we formally mark them as `#[deprecated]`.
  Use `MockExecutor` (and its `SimpleMockTimeProvider`) instead.
  That's a nontrivial change since the time mocking API is quite different.
  ([#1885], [!2843])
- The `arti hss onion-name` command is now deprecated in favor of the new
  `arti hss onion-address` command.
  ([#1879], [!2840])
- `OnionService::onion_name` and `RunningOnionService::onion_name` are deprecated.
  Use `OnionService::onion_address` and `RunningOnionService::onion_address` instead.
  ([#1879], [!2840], [!2859])
- In `tor-general-addr`, `NoUnixAddressSupport` is renamed
  to `NoAfUnixSocketSupport`.
  No change to the semantics, just corrected terminology.
  The old name is still present as a deprecated type alias, so some
  (but not all) uses of the old name will still work for now.
  ([#827], [!2841])
- In `tor-rtcompat`, `UnsupportedUnixAddressType` is renamed
  to `UnsupportedAfUnixAddressType`.
  No change to the semantics, just corrected terminology.
  The old name is still present as a deprecated type alias, so some (but
  not all) uses of the old name will still work for now.
  ([#827], [!2841])

### Conflux development

- Reworked circuit reactor loop to read from, and write to,
  all of its configured circuit legs. ([#1863], [!2817], [!2830])
- New control commands for shutting down the circuit reactor
  and obtaining its (only) circuit. ([#1876], [!2829])
- Encapsulated circuit internals inside a new module,
  to avoid unnecessarily exposing them inside the circuit reactor.
  ([!2837])
- The circuit reactor now supports resolving `HopLocation`s
  to a hop on a particular circuit leg. ([!2839])
- Added constructors for conflux cell types. ([!2858])
- Introduced an additional `CircuitCmd` type in the circuit reactor
  representing an action to be executed in the context of a circuit.
  ([!2881])
- Refactored and simplified an internal `ConfluxSet` API. ([!2884])

### RPC development

- The RPC subsystem is now marked as stable. ([#1883], [!2871])
- Added configuration examples. ([#1830], [!2887])
- Arti now warns when RPC is configured but not enabled at compile-time.
 ([#1830], [!2887])

### Testing

- Overhaul Runtime APIs for sync-async interaction. ([#1835], [!2810])
- Refactor the `tor-keymgr` `key_specifier` tests. ([#1889], [!2849])
- Increased test coverage for `arti-rpc-client-core`. ([!2865], [!2870])
- Added tests for the RPC configuration options. ([#1830], [!2887])
- Replaced stringly-typed metadata with a new `ItemMetadata` type in
  the `tor-keymgr` tests. ([#1888], [!2848])
- In `tor-keymgr`, add tests for interoperability with
  `ssh-keygen`-generated tests. ([#1455], [!2873])

### Documentation

- Added missing build dependencies to [CONTRIBUTING.md]. ([!2836])
- Fixed `arti` binary path in example usage. ([!2844])
- Clarified documentation for RPC authentication type "none".
  ([#1820], [!2872])
- Added style guide for Unix domain sockets terminology. ([#827], [!2841])
- Fixed broken code of conduct link. ([!2882])
- Updated the Tor Browser version from the `download-manager` example.
  ([!2888])

### Infrastructure

- CI now uses the GitLab Dependency Proxy,
  which caches images pulled from DockerHub,
  in order to bypass rate-limiting. ([!2797])
- Various improvements to the release process. ([!2832], [!2834])
- The `cargo-audit` maintenance script now temporarily ignores the
  [RUSTSEC-2024-0436] advisory regarding the unmaintained `paste` crate.
  ([!2847])
- Temporarily ignored [RUSTSEC-2025-0014] advisory
  regarding `humantime` crate deprecation.
  ([!2852], [#1892], [#1893], [!2857])
- Parallelized the `matrix-check` job in CI. ([#1625], [!2835])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

- Removed unnecessary `async` block from circuit reactor.
  ([!2815])
- Include HsDir RSA identity in onion service client debug logs.
  ([!2833])
- Arti now uses [`rustls-webpki`] instead of [`x509-signature`]
  when the `ruslts` feature is enabled. ([#1824], [#1854], [!2816])
- When expiring a consensus, Arti now removes its blob from disk.
  ([#1655], [!2504], [!2838])
- Removed incorrect deprecation warning from `hsc` subcommand. ([!2845])
- `Circuit::add_hop` is now fallible. ([!2855])
- `TimePeriod` now implements `Display`. ([!2851])
- Removed a TODO about error handling in the `arti hss` subcommand.
  ([!2846])
- Arti now rejects netdocs that contain BOMs or internal NULs.
  ([#1739], [!2866])
- New `State::is_fully_reachable` API for checking
  if an onion service is fully reachable.
  ([#1890], [!2850])
- `arti hsc key get` now prints a newline after the service discovery key.
  ([!2856])
- The experimental `arti hsc key get` subcommand now reads onion addresses
  from stdin.
  ([#1630], [!2861])
- `TorClient` now stores the state directory as a `StateDirectory` object,
   instead of as a raw directory and corresponding `Mistrust`.
   ([!2863])
- Added support for subprotocol version mnemonics. ([#1891], [!2854])
- `maint/cargo_sort` now works correctly when run against forks that
  are not called `arti`.
  ([#1868], [!2864])
- The circuit reactor is now more robust against several types
  of invalid control messages, returning an error over the user-provided
  channel instead of shutting down. ([!2867])
- Add an explicit type annotation in
  `ParetoTimeoutEstimator::learning_timeouts`. ([#1915], [!2886])
- Fixed `fs-mistrust` compilation on tvOS. ([!2890])
- The circuit reactor no longer busy-loops when there are no ready streams.
  ([!2885])
- Upgraded to the latest versions of `strum`, `rustls-webpki`, `getrandom`,
  `cbindgen`.
  ([!2894], [!2901])

# Arti 1.4.1 â€” 3 March 2025

Arti 1.4.1 contains
significant behind-the-scenes groundwork for [Conflux],
a feature that improves performance and reliability
by allowing data streams to tunnel over multiple circuits.

It also adds client-side support for an
[improved representation of family membership][prop321].

### Major features

- Arti now implements the client side of ID-based families
  (a.k.a. ["Happy Families"][prop321]).
  When deployed everywhere on the network,
  this feature will allow us
  to remove around 80-90% of the data from microdescriptors,
  and save some administrative complexity.
  ([#1848], [!2792])

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- Removed the deprecated experimental `DataStream::circuit` API. ([!2794])
- Removed the `ClientCirc::channel` API. ([!2783])
- Functions in `tor-netdir` and `tor-relay-selection` related to families

# Arti 1.4.0 â€” 7 February 2025

Arti 1.4.0 offers a new [RPC interface], continues work on the relay
implementation, includes an overhaul of the [in-tree
documentation](https://tpo.pages.torproject.net/core/arti/).

## Dedication

The Arti 1.4.0 release is dedicated to the memory of JÃ©rÃ©my Bobbio
(1982-2024), known in our community as Lunar. Lunar was a Tor volunteer, free
software hacker, and community organizer.

Inside Tor, Lunar will be remembered for leading the efforts around Tor's old
Weekly News newsletter, but also for caring deeply about both the organization
the people around the organization.

Outside of Tor, Lunar worked on highly successful free software projects such
as the Debian project and helped build the infrastructure and tooling around
the Reproducible Builds project, a project that continues to benefit the
broader ecosystem.

Lunar will be deeply missed, both in our community and in the many other communities he participated in.

See also what other projects are writing about Lunar:

- [The Debian Project](https://www.debian.org/News/2024/20241119)
- [lunar.anargeek.net](https://lunar.anargeek.net/)
- [Linux Weekly News](https://lwn.net/Articles/997775/)
- [The Reproducible Builds Project](https://reproducible-builds.org/news/2024/11/14/reproducible-builds-mourns-the-passing-of-lunar/)

## Changes in this release

### Breaking changes

- `Runtime` now implies `SpawnBlocking` with `spawn_blocking`.
  Out-of-tree implementors of `Runtime` will need to change.
  ([!2678])

### Major features

- Arti's [RPC interface] is now ready for use.
  Arti RPC is the replacement for C Tor's [control port]
  with many improvements.
  (At present the available *functionality*, offered over RPC, is limited.)

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- `tor-chanmgr`: `AbstractChannel` now has a `reparameterize_kist()` method.
  ([!2706])
- `tor-key-forge`: `ErasedKey` is now `Box<dyn ItemType>`;
  `EncodableItem::item_type()` moved to `ItemType`;
  `ToEncodableCert::Cert` replaced with `::ParsedCert` and `::EncodableCert`;
  `ToEncodableCert::validate` now takes a `Self::ParsedCert`
  and returns `Self`;
  `ToEncodableCert::from_encodableCert` removed.
  ([!2672])
- `tor-proto`: `StreamOps` trait now has a (defaulted) `new_handle` function;
  any wrapper implementing `StreamOps` should also wrap it.
  ([!2706])
- `tor-proto`: stream types are now required to implement `StreamOps`.
  ([!2706])
- `tor-rtcompat`: in many traits, stream types must now implement `StreamOps`.
  ([!2706])
- `tor-proto`: `ConversationInHandler` now only has one lifetime parameter;
  and `::send_message` is now `async`.
  ([!2747])
- `fs-mistrust`: A few methods now take `&self` rather than `self`.
  ([!2707])

### Relay development

- Major refactoring of the circuit reactor, to use `select!`, lifting it from
  async Rust's low-level "poll" to "async fn".
  ([!2747], [!2733], [#1816], [!2720], [!2760], [#1832], [!2768], [!2765])
- Improved CLI and add config loading.
  ([!2699], [#1736], [!2709])
- High-level certificate types (implementing `ToEncodableCert`)
  in `tor-relay-crypto`.
  ([!2672], [#1777])
- Initial [KIST] support (Linux-only) in `tor-proto`.
  ([!2706], [#1728], [#1728], [#1729], [#1730])
- Congestion control.
  ([proposal 324], [!2675], [#534])
- Apply the standard lint block.
  ([!2708])

### RPC development

- Cookie authentication.
  ([!2702], [#1529], [!2716])
- Fixed the remaining outstanding TODOs in the RPC code.
  ([!2740], [!2743], [!2745], [!2737], [!2731])
- Improved names for many type and methods:
  `MethodNotFound` to `NoSuchMethod`
  ([!2714], [#1500]);
  `new_stream_handle` to `new_oneshot_client`
  ([!2715], [#1664]);
  make `Params`/`Reply` structs consistent.
  ([!2729], [#1586], [!2732])
- Implement request cancellation.
  ([!2722], [#818])
- Fix portability problems on Windows.
  ([!2761], [#1831], [!2713], [#1798], [!2756], [!2718])
- Move support for weak references behind an experimental feature,
  and clean up some related comments.
  ([!2742], [#868], [!2741])
- Improve and write a bunch of RPC documentation.
  ([!2748], [#1520], [#1527], [#1296])
- Fixes and maintenance on rpc-docs-tool.
  ([!2736], [#1520], [#1708])
- No longer generate internal errors for expected situations.
  ([!2730])
- Tolerate nonexistence of a the connect point directory.
  ([!2735])
- Improve error outputs, including the origin of each failed connect attempt.
  ([!2766], [#1650], [#1826], [!2744], [#1826])
- `fs-mistrust`: New facilities for file access.
  ([!2707], [#1746])
- Clarify and fix some issues surrounding relative paths.
  ([!2712], [#1748], [#1749])
- Tweaked `tor-proto` `StreamCtrl` APIs to better support use with RPC.
  ([!2755])
- Document stream optimism.
  ([!2753], [#1583])
- Specify the RPC connection banner format.
  ([!2700], [#1753])

### Other development

- Update plan for Proof of Work DoS prevention, `service-side-pow.md`.
  ([!2701])
- Design notes for implementation of [Conflux].
  ([!2750])

### Documentation

- Rewrite download manager example.
  ([!2725], [#1471], [#1386])
- `arti`: Add `restricted-discovery` to the list of experimental
  features in the crate documentation.
  ([!2719], [#1808])
- `tor-config`: clarify that `ConfigurationSources::set_mistrust`is
  unrelated to the paths defined within the configuration file itself,
  and reference `storage.permissions.dangerously_trust_everyone`.
  ([!2727])
- Integrate the Docusaurus-based documentation overhaul
  (aka [`arti-doc-project-2023`]) into `arti.git/web/`
  and deploy it to <https://tpo.pages.torproject.net/core/arti/>.
  ([!2746], [!2752], [!2754], [!2757])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

- Fix `watch_configuration = true`.  Previously this caused an infinite loop
  and was not useable.
  ([#1794], [!2696])
- `tor-circmgr`: Add trace log on circuit build timeout.
  ([!2698])
- `tor-proto`: Make `Channel::wait_for_close` non-experimental.
  ([!2666])
- Fix non-Unix build and test failures.
  ([!2615], [!2738], [#1809], [!2717])
- Replace an async `Mutex` with a sync one in file watcher.
  ([!2763])
- Remove confusing `use asynchronous_codec as futures_codec`.
  ([#1690], [!2769])
- Fix many typos.
  ([!2751])

### Testing

- `tor-rtmock`: Fix misleading task lists from `MockExecutor` when panicking
  due to stall and tasks unstick each other in `Drop`.
  ([!2682])
- `tor-proto`: Fix flaky test `invalid_circ_sendme` by using
  `MockExecutor` and replacing `sleep()` with `advance_until_stalled()`.
  ([!2721])
- More uniform handling of some test key data.
  ([!2764], [#1396])

### Infrastructure

- `maint/matrix-check`: properly find the crate subdir.
  ([!2762])
- Un-ignore [RUSTSEC-2024-0421] as we no longer use an affected `hickory`.
  ([!2693], [#1773])
- Update our main CI image (`RECENT_RUST_IMAGE`) to 1.83.
  ([!2694])
- Better instructions for handling new MPL-licensed dependencies.
  ([!2726])
- Style guide for this changelog, and small script to help format it.
  ([!2739], [!2616])

# Arti 1.3.2 â€” 7 January 2025

Arti 1.3.2 continues development on RPC,
and includes preparatory work for relay support and
service-side onion service denial-of-service resistance.

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- In `tor-rtcompat`, stream types now implement a `StreamOps` trait
  to provide additional operations.
  Currently, the only supported operation is `set_tcp_notsent_lowat`,
  which will be used in our [KIST] implementation.
  ([#1769], [!2660], [!2673])
- In `tor-key-forge`, the `Error` type no longer implements `HasKind`:
  the correct behavior for this error depends on higher-level context.
  ([!2664])
- In `tor-keymgr`, the `EncodeableKey` trait has been replaced with
  a `EncodeableItem` trait. ([!2635])
- In `tor-keymgr`, the `KeyType::Unknown` variant has been removed.
  ([!2635])

### Onion service development

- Design for integration of proof-of-work into Arti's service-side
  onion-service implementation. ([!2663])

### Relay development

- The key-manager code can now store certificates as well as keys.
  ([#1617], [!2644])

### Directory authority development

- Design for the necessary behaviors and pieces of
  a directory authority implementation.
  ([!2635])

### RPC development

- Initial implementation for RPC connect points,
  which will provide a mechanism for applications to discover where
  Arti is running, and connect to it securely.
  This implementation is now working, but not yet fully conformant
  to its specification.
  ([!2655], [!2667], [!2676])

### Documentation

- Clarifications to release instructions about communications surrounding
  releases.
  ([!2614])
- Update copyright statements to 2025.
  ([!2658], [!2687])

### Infrastructure

- New "exclude" feature in our `fixup-features` tool,
  to avoid crates that we don't publish.
  ([#1766], [!2652])
- Use internally maintained images in our CI instructions,
  to reduce pulls from dockerhub.
  ([!2656])
- Pin Python CI tasks to specific tool versions,
  to avoid surprising breakage.
  ([!2683])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

- Suppress the new [`clippy::needless_lifetimes`] warning;
  it affects a large amount of code, and isn't a clear readability benefit.
  ([64cc3f2ed3eea0b7c5cc])
- Resolve new Clippy warnings introduced in Rust 1.83.
  ([#1765], [!2654])
- Deny the [`clippy::mod_module_files`] lint, for style consistency.
  ([!2689])
- Consolidate logic for close detection on Channels.
  ([!2645])
- Label the output of our `cbindgen` script with the version of cbindgen,
  to help detect incompatibility.
  ([!2662])
- Remove dependency from `tor-key-forge` onto `tor-hscrypto`.
  ([#1778], [!2668])
- In `fs-mistrust`, improve environment-variable handling,
  document stability guarantees.
  ([!2674], [!2677])
- Miscellaneous typo fixes.
  ([!2680])

# Arti 1.3.1 - 2 December 2024

Arti 1.3.1 continues development on onion services,
the RPC subsystem, and relay infrastructure.

Additionally, this release fixes a major bug in Arti's channel management code,
where in some circumstances, canceled pending channel entries
were not being cleaned up properly, preventing Arti from building new channels
to their target relays.

### Major bugfixes

- `ChanMgr::get_or_launch` is now cancellation-safe.
  ([#1716], [!2646], [!2625])

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates
- Removed the `expand-feature`
  and the  `CfgPath` and `CfgPathError` re-exports from `tor-config`.
  ([#1717], [!2593])
- In `tor-config-path`, `CfgPath::path` now takes
  a `CfgPathResolver` argument. ([!2615])
- In `tor-ptmgr`, `PtMgr::new` now takes
  a `CfgPathResolver` argument. ([!2615])
- Moved the `NetdirProviderShutdown` error from `tor-hsservice`
  to `tor-netdir`. ([!2609])
- `HsIdParseError` no longer has an `HasKind` implementation.
  ([!2607])
- When the `keymgr` feature is disabled in `tor-keymgr`,
  `KeyMgr` no longer exposes `insert` and `remove` APIs.
  ([#1732], [!2631])
- In `tor-checkable`, `TimeRangeBound` now returns
  a tuple of `Option<SystemTime>` instead of `Bound<SystemTime>`.
  ([#1691], [1659495eb30ae6a17058418b6d00592373cfdf65])

### Onion service development
- The `HasKind` implementation of `ErrorDetail`
  now returns an `InvalidStreamTarget` error kind for `BadOnionAddress`.
  ([!2607])
- Began laying the groundwork for service-side proof-of-work support.
  ([#1751], [!2609], [!2642])

### Relay development
- Relay signing key specifiers now encode a timestamp,
  which will enable Arti to store more than one `K_relaysign_ed`
  per relay in the keystore.
  ([#1692], [!2577])
- Fixed `ChanMgr` reconfiguration bug when using `Reconfigure::CheckAllOrNothing`.
  ([!2619])
- Added an initial CLI interface to the `arti-relay` binary.
  ([#1736], [!2630])
- Designed new certificate management APIs for the key manager.
  ([#1617], [!2565])
- `arti-relay` now uses `tokio` as its async runtime.
  ([#1744], [!2634])
- `tor-config-path` now uses a `CfgPathResolver` for expanding variables in `CfgPath`,
  rather than a static hardcoded list.
  ([#1672], [!2615])
- Channel request cancellation errors are now immediately retriable.
  ([!2640])

### RPC development
- Added many clarifications and improvements to the RPC connect point spec.
  ([!2602], [!2623], [!2629])
- New `CfgAddr` type to represent socket addresses in configuration.
  ([#1528], [!2597])
- New `tor-connect-point` crate providing an initial backend implementation
  for RPC connect point management.
  ([#1528], [!2629])

### Testing
- Re-enabled the `test_parse` test in `tor-config-path`.
  ([cc2aff554c43e6b52bfea8f5378b3ee8dde35645])
- Updated `unix_literal` test to use `USER_HOME` instead of `HOME`.
  ([!2612])
- Added benchmarks for cell encryption and decryption in `tor-proto`.
  ([!2608])

### Documentation
- Fixed inaccurate `RecvWindow::take` documentation.
  ([!2611])
- Updated the README to point to the updated anonticket URL.
  ([!2622])
- Added documentation describing the life cycle of a cell,
  and various observations about the circuit and channel reactors.
  ([#1747], [!2637])

### Infrastructure

- CI job output is now split into collapsible and individually-timed sections.
  ([!2605])
- The `python3-checks` job no longer unnecessarily installs
  the `mypy` and `flake8` packages from `apt`.
  ([!2618])
- Simplified `chutney` installation in CI,
  in preparation for "cloning" the Arti chutney-related CI into chutney's CI.
  ([!2600])
- The `cargo-audit` maintenance script now temporarily ignores the
  [RUSTSEC-2024-0384] advisory regarding the unmaintained `instant` crate.
  ([!2627])
- Our license-checking code now allows the license used by `unicode-ident`.
  ([!2647])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes
- `tor-persist` now has a `Iso8601TimeSlug` API for encoding timestamps as `Slug`s
  that can appear within filenames.
  ([38d1e334007143bba5ec4b483f9e04b1f3ea23a1])
- Upgraded `hashbrown` to version 0.15.1.
  ([#1725], [!2613])
- It is now an error to modify the `cache_trust` configuration at runtime.
  ([#1721], [!2620])
- Removed exploratory code in comment in `tor-config-path`. ([!2610])
- Upgraded to the latest versions of
  `thiserror`, `rustls`, `sanitize-filename`, and `tinystr`.
  ([#1741], [!2626], [!2641], [!2647])
- Removed dead code from `tor-keymgr`. ([!2638])
- Fixed various new clippy warnings. ([!2639])

# Arti 1.3.0 - 31 October 2024

Arti 1.3.0 is a significant milestone: we have achieved parity on most
major client features with C Tor.  The last big security feature needed for
Onion Services (resistance to out-of-memory DoS) landed in this release.
And, in Arti client 1.3.0, connecting to `.onion` domains is enabled by
default.

Much other major work is taking place, too!  We have continued our work on
Arti Relay.  The work-in-progress RPC system is significantly more clearly
defined and implementation is proceeding.

### Breaking changes

 * **Reject (managed) pluggable transport on non-localhost address:** If a
   pluggable transport we spawn tells us it is listening on a non-localhost
   address, reject that transport, since this is almost certainly a
   security risk.  (The goal is to detect buggy PTs.  We aren't aware of
   any such PTs.)  ([!2454], [#1636])

 * **API:** Several methods (mostly in `tor-chanmgr` and `tor-proto`)
   take new memory quota tracking arguments.  If memory tracking is not
   required, you can create a no-op memory quota account with
   `SpecificAccount::new_noop()` or `Account::new_noop().

 * **API:** New API for `tor-socksproto`, which is more robust and avoids
   many kinds of misuse, including bugs like TROVE-2024-010.  The old
   `.handshake` method still available, but deprecated, and now part of the
   new `Handshake` trait.  ([#1590], [#1627], [#1592], [!2436])

 * **API:** Many places where a `SleepProvider` bound was used now also
   require `CoarseTimeProvider`.  In-tree `SleepProvider`s all implement
   `CoarseTimeProvider`, so for most callers this can be fixed by
   propagating the bounds.  ([!2482])

 * **cargo features:** Some cargo features of lower-layer crates are no
   longer enabled by implication by higher-layer crates.  External callers
   may need to add feature requesgts to `Cargo.toml`s.  ([!2498])

### Major new features

 * **Support memory quota tracking.**  (Feature compiled in by default.)
   Specifically: Arti can now try to limit the amount of memory it uses for
   data that might be originated by untrusted parties.  This is currently
   useful as DoS resistance measure for Hidden Services (`.onion`
   services).  To actually enable this, a specific limit must be imposed in
   the `[system]` section of of the Arti configuration.  ([!2459], [!2461],
   [!2484], [!2493], [!2508], [!2509], [!2518], [!2531], [!2536], [!2537], [!2545],
   [!2555], [!2560], [!2569], [#1682], [#351])
 * **Enabled connecting to `.onion` addresses (Hidden Services) by
   default,** by making `allow_onion_addrs` default to `true` in the
   configuration.  (This is appropriate now that we have Vanguard support.)
   ([#1402], [!2506])

### Bugfixes

 * Fixed the build of `arti-client` with just the features `experimental-api`
   and `onion-service-client` enabled.  ([!2457], [#1638])
 * Fixed the build on FreeBSD.  ([!2533], [#1686])
 * Fixed the build on NetBSD.  ([!2540], [rust-pwd-grp#4], [rust-pwd-grp!25])
 * Fixed config file watching (file notifier) on non-Windows platforms
   without inotify.  ([!2547], [#1644], [notify-rs#644])
 * Fixed a bug that rendered Arti unable to connect to the Tor network
   when built with certain library combinations.
   This could occur
   when an out-of-tree user of the Arti libraries ends up enabling
   `time-rs`'s `large-dates` cargo feature, by replacing `simple_asn1`
   dependency with `der-parser` in `tor-llcrypto`.  ([!2462], [#1632],
   [simple_asn1#34], [simple_asn1!35], [time-rs#683])
 * Fixed the logging of backtraces, when an internal error occurs.
   (Bug first appeared in Arti 1.2.7.)  [!2588], [#1713])
 * Removed a false claim that we don't support pluggable transports.  ([!2507])
 * Documented the `vanguards` cargo feature flag.  ([!2507])

### Other user-facing improvements

 * Warn if we're configured to listen for SOCKS or DNS queries on a
   non-localhost address, or if we're configured to use an
   externally-managed pluggable transport with a non-localhost address,
   These are very questionable configurations, but there may be unusual
   situations where this is a sensible setup.  ([!2454], [#1636])
 * Use new "restricted discovery" terminology throughout (for Hidden
   Services, aka `.onion` services), replacing previous (misleading)
   "client authorization".  ([!2495], [#1476])
 * Experimental ability to read private keys from C Tor's on-disk keystore.
   ([!2481], [!2514])
 * Experimental proof-of-work client-side support for Hidden Services
   (`.onion` services).  ([!2486], [!2026])

### New library and API features

 * Added `general::SocketAddr` type for unifying IP and AF\_UNIX (and
   potentially other) sockets.  ([!2519], [#1681], [!2553], [!2554], [#1701],
   [!2592])
 * Added type-erased `DynTimeProvider` in `tor-rtcompat`.  ([!2460], [!2500])
 * Added `SinkTrySend` and `SinkCloseChannel` traits, making the
   functionality of `mpsc::Sender::try_send` and `::close` available as a
   trait method and implementable for other types.  ([!2468], [!2485], [!2490])
 * Added `SometimesUnboundedSink::as_inner` method.  ([!2483])
 * Guarantee that `Slug`s will never contain colons (`:`), and explain why.
   ([!2576])
 * Moved `tor-config`'s `path` module to a new crate `tor-config-path`.
   ([!2590])
 * Added `default-runtime` feature in `arti`, to simplify building without
   default features.  ([!2551])

### Relay development

 * Support multiple channels for a single relay ID.  ([!2442], [#1633])
 * Improved channel selection code.  ([!2477], [#1602], [!2544])
 * Much other cleanup and refactoring in `tor-chanmgr`.  ([!2523], [!2538],
   [#1654], [!2566])
 * Made `arti-relay` be a binary crate only, for now at least, and abolish
   the `relay` subcommand of the main `arti` CLI.  ([!2525], [#1674], [!2542])

### RPC system development

 * Reorganised RPC documentation; soon it will be a mdbook.  ([!2581])
 * Improved documentation for writing RPC callers, including a new Python
   tool to build RPC method and type documentation.  ([!2479], [!2489]
   [!2574])
 * Finalised specifications for how RPC clients should find the Arti RPC
   server, how the server should decide where to listen, and how
   authentication will be done.  ([!2439], [!2440], [!2439], [#1521], [!2563],
   [#1702], [!2582], [#1711])
 * Finalised specifications for version compatibility (interworking of
   newer/older Arti with newer/older RPC clients).  ([!2475], [#1634], [!2510],
   [#1665], [!2511], [#1662], [!2512])
 * Improvements to error handling, especially in the client library.
   ([!2556])
 * Improved and clarified objectid/isolation rules in SOCKS interaction.
   ([!2474], [torspec!292], [proposal 351], [socks-extensions.md])
 * Clarified (and weakened) guarantees provided on request cancellation.
   ([!2564], [#818])
 * Changed `release` method to be a method on the object itself.  ([!2573],
   [#1663])
 * Other specification fixes/improvements.  ([#1678], [!2539])
 * Fixed the shared library extension on OSX and Windows.  ([!2469])
 * Removed the `Echo` testing/demo method.  ([!2549], [#1525])
 * Started a Python client API, and adopted it for some integration
   tests.  ([!2515], [#1295], [!2567])
 * Reduced the dependencies of the client library.  ([!2522], [!2524])
 * Internal cleanups.  ([!2456], [#1587], [!2558])

### Documentation

 * Clarified `launch_onion_service_with_hsid()`.  ([!2494], [#1626])
 * Use new "circuit stem" terminology.  ([#1479], [!2410])
 * Added missing docs for `keypair_specifier`.  ([!2532])

### Testing

 * Much better testing for the CircMgr.  ([!2444], [!2513])
 * Fixed the flaky `circuit::test::accept_valid_sendme` CI test.  ([!2501])
 * Added more miri tests.  ([!2502])
 * Avoid writing `_ => panic!()` even in tests.  ([!2534])
 * Allow more precise testing of conditional compilation which affects the
   configuration reader.  ([!2561])
 * Updated to the latest version of Shadow.  ([!2585], [shadow!3428], [!2587])
 * Include more output from Shadow in CI artifacts.  ([!2586])
 * Pin the version of Chutney used in Shadow tests to make arti.git CI more
   hermetic.  ([!2596])

### Cleanups and housekeeping

 * Updated the list of fallback directories. Clients use these to fetch
   directory information when they have no cached directory or guard
   nodes.  ([!2589])
 * Updated some previous entries in `CHANGELOG.md` to more fully document
   changes in `tor-circmgr` 0.23.0.
 * Now we run a typechecker, linter, and autoformatter, on all our Python
   scripts (and fix the issues identified).  ([!2476], [!2578], [!2579],
   [#1689], [!2584])
 * Minor cleanups and reformatting in `tor-key-forge`.  ([!2552])
 * Commented out (temporarily) ill-shaped `RelaySigningKeySpecifier`.  ([!2527])
 * Reduced the number of "unused" warnings arising from conditional
   compilation (eg, cargo features).  ([!2431], [!2463], [#1645], [!2551])
 * In `Cargo.toml`, avoid updating to a `typed-index-collections` which
   would break our MSRV by requiring Rust 1.81.  ([!2471], [#1647])
 * Tidied up the sealing of a pair of traits.  ([!2472])
 * Use `{u64,usize}::div_ceil` where applicable.  ([!2473])
 * Now we avoid some warnings about certain elided lifetimes.  ([!2478], [!2575])
 * Fixed docs-rs cargo feature decorations on certain items.  ([!2487])
 * Forbid hard tabs (in most files) in tree.  ([!2488])
 * Fixed `no_default_features = true` typo in many `Cargo.toml`.  ([!2498])
 * Bumped dependency requirements for `futures-*` `notify`.  ([!2499])
 * Fixed indentation in a doc comment to address a new clippy lint.  ([!2516],
   [!2520])
 * Changed to depend on `slotmap-careful` instead of `slotmap`.  ([!2530],
   [#1531])
 * Abolished unneeded use of `python-is-python3` package in CI.  ([!2535])
 * Reinstated the `tor-proto` circuit hop check in `test_create()`.  ([!2546])
 * Updated download size numbers (for Project 101 Q3-2024).  ([!2571])
 * Simplified `tor-config` path handling by using `path` feature of
   `shellexpand`.  ([!2583])
 * Work around a bug in `cargo license` by permitting a weird licence
   string.  ([!2591], [cargo-license#78])
 * Removed an obsolete TODO.  ([!2562])

# Arti 1.2.8 â€” 1 October 2024

Arti 1.2.8 continues development on onion services,
the RPC subsystem, key management, and relay infrastructure.
It also includes fixes for two security issues in
handling the SOCKS protocol, the most severe of which is rated at
"medium" according to our [security policy].

Arti 1.2.8 also increases our MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version)
to 1.77, in accordance with our [MSRV policy].

### Breaking changes

- Arti now requires Rust 1.77 or later. ([!2421], [!2451])
- The `arti hsc` subcommand is now gated behind the experimental `hsc`
  feature until it is ready for general use. ([ab41a9d330ed1db])

### Security fixes

- Temporarily reject attempts to send optimistic data before
  the SOCKS handshake is complete.
  Previously, we would discard data in this case,
  which has the potential to cause mis-framing bugs that could enable
  cross-protocol attacks under some circumstances.
  This is tracked as TROVE-2024-010.
  We intend to add full support for optimistic data soon;
  this is a temporary workaround.
  ([#1627], [!2443])
- Prevent an infinite loop that could occur in our SOCKS code
  if a local connection was closed at the wrong time.
  This is tracked as TROVE-2024-011.
  ([#1635], [!2447])

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- The `tor-bytes` crate now reports `Incomplete` rather than `Truncated`
  for most reader types. ([#1614], [!2407])
- Removed some deprecated code in `tor-hsservice`. ([7a838da0ff2359f9])
- The "ephemeral keystore" feature in `tor-keymgr` is now marked as
  experimental, and available behind an `ephemeral-keystore` feature.
  ([!2426])
- The `tor-rtcompat` crate now supports AF_UNIX sockets,
  and provides a more generic API
  for opening and listening for network streams.
  To this end, several of its APIs have been renamed or refactored,
  and the `Runtime` trait now depends on more supertraits.
  ([#1152], [!2437])
- In `tor-rtcompat`, `TcpListener::accept()` no longer exists.
  Use `NetStreamListener::incoming()` instead.
  ([168f55df05f4b56f])
- In `arti-client`, the type for `StorageConfig::keystore` has changed.
  ([5e4e7b69b8cd2791])
- In `tor-circmgr`, the `CircMgr` `reload_persistent_state`,
  `store_persistent_state`, and `upgrade_to_owned_persistent_state` functions
  have been removed. ([!2420])
- In `tor-circmgr`, the function `CircMgr::new` now returns a `CircMgr` rather
  than an `Arc<CircMgr>`. ([!2420])
- In `tor-circmgr`, the deprecated `CircMgr::update_network_parameters`
  function has been removed. ([!2420])
- In `tor-hsservice`, numerous types related to initialization and status
  have been renamed or refactored.
  ([!2397], [!2413])
- In `tor-keymgr`, several types have been renamed.
  ([5e4e7b69b8cd279], [80095da1aa47978])
- In `tor-netdir`, several test-network construction callbacks
  now take an extra parameter.
  ([b2b75302ab095bc])

### Onion service development

- Remove the number of cases in which an onion service needs to know
  its secret identity key `KS_hs_id`.
  This will help with implementing offline key support.
  ([#1194], [!2393])
- Add support for adding externally generated keys;
  this will also help with offline key support.
  ([#1613], [!2396])
- Report onion service status correctly based on upload results.
  This includes major refactoring to onion service status reporting,
  and significant tests.
  ([#1572], [!2397])
- Remove setting for non-anonymous ("single onion") services.
  We don't actually support them yet.
  ([!2413])
- Defer generating service identity keys (`K_hs_id`)
  until the service is actually launched.
  This allows tools like `onion-name` to check whether these keys are present.
  ([!2417])
- The `arti hss onion-name` subcommand now has support for generating
  identity keys on demand. ([#1621], [!2419])
- Experimental support for launching onion service with user-provided
  identity keys. ([#1612], [!2402])
- Allow arti to run with onion services only, and SOCKS/DNS ports  disabled.
  ([#1569], [!2423])
- Move onion service client key management functionality
  into a new `arti hsc key` sub-command,
  which supports key inspection, rotation, and deletion.
  The old `arti hsc get-key` subcommand is now deprecated.
  ([#1475], [!2432], [!2435])
- Support making an `InertTorClient` with an emphemeral key manager.
  ([#1610], [!2394])
- The "default" keystore has been renamed to "primary".
  ([!2438])

### Relay development

- Give `TorRelay` an instance of `ChanMgr` to keep track of open channels.
  ([!2361])
- Continued development on memory-quota support,
  to prevent memory-based denial-of-service attacks
  against relays and onion services. ([!2374], [!2404])
- New `tor-key-forge` crate
  for defining specific key and keypair wrappers,
  for use with relay keys.
  ([#1137], [#1619], [!2356], [!2430], [!2433])
- Define a set of high-level error wrappers for use by the `TorRelay` code.
  ([!2392])
- The channel manager now has (partial) support for receiving and handling
  incoming channels. ([!2389])
- Initial key generation and management support for relays.
  ([#1604], [!2411])
- Move Arti's (in-progress) `relay` subcommand to its own module. ([!2455)

### RPC development

- Add support throughout the RPC stack
  for opening data streams and registering them with the RPC system,
  using the protocol developed in [proposal 351].
  ([#1524], [!2373], [!2401], [!2406], [!2409], [!2434], [!2452])
- Update RPC specification draft to match current reality and plans.
  ([!2386], [!2453])
- Refactor the way that the RPC service handles errors,
  to ensure that framing errors are never silently tolerated,
  and other errors are handled uniformly.
  ([#1591], [!2400])
- Expose a list of object delegation types,
  to make it possible to generate full documentation
  of which objects support which methods.
  ([#1624], [!2418])
- Add a (work-in-progress! unstable! experimental!) Python wrapper
  for our similarly unstable RPC client library.
  ([!2446])

### Testing

- Partially fix test nondeterminism in the `reload_cfg::watch_single_file` test.
  ([#1549], [!2375], [!2391])
- Improve performance for the `reload_cfg::watch_multiple` test.
  ([#1589], [!2387])
- [Chutney] network integration tests are now
  run inside the [Shadow] discrete event simulator.
  ([!2427])

### Documentation

- Typo fixes in our documentation. ([!2403])
- Improved documentation for onion service descriptor publication.
  ([#1216], [b87b9f44ae05d4f0])
- Clean up documentation for `InertTorClient`. ([!2414])
- Clarify behavior of `ArtiEphemeralKeystore`. ([!2424])
- New example: running an axum router as an onion service.
  ([!2445])
- Add an example for an onion service's `reject` option to our
  sample configuration. ([!2458])

### Infrastructure

- Clean-ups to CI jobs that generate debian packages.
  ([!2368])
- Adjust exceptions for `downgrade-dependencies` script.
  ([!2398], [!2451], [cf7f25851ac0319f])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

- Move Arti's `proxy` subcommand to its own module. ([!2416])
- Clean up needless abstraction, and add smarter abstraction,
  to make `tor-circmgr` easier to test.
  ([!2412], [!2420])
- When encountering truncated data, the `tor-bytes` crates now
  gives a lower-bound estimate for how much more data would be needed
  in order produce a successful parse. ([!2390])
- The `tor-bytes` crate now tracks whether its inputs are possibly
  incomplete, and only reports "Truncated" data as a recoverable error
  on a possibly incomplete data.
  This helps to prevent a category of bug
  (which it appears our code doesn't actually have)
  where we might erroneously
  keep reading more data without limit.
  ([#1614], [!2407])
- Fix a bug in our SOCKS handling
  that would cause us to exceed the bounds of a buffer,
  causing the SOCKS task to exit with a panic.
  ([dceeb82f7d115489])
- Upgrade to the latest versions of `float-cmp` and `derive-more`.
  ([!2450])
- Keystore configuration options have been significantly revised;
  there is now a `keystore.primary.kind` option
  to configure the primary keystore.
  ([!2441])

# Arti 1.2.7 â€” 3 September 2024

Arti 1.2.7 continues development on onion service client authorization,
the RPC subsystem, and relay infrastructure.

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates
- In [`tor-hsservice`],
  `OnionServiceProxyConfigBuilder` no longer derives `Eq` and `PartialEq`,
  and `DescEncryptionConfig`, `DescEncryptionConfig`,
  `AuthorizedClientConfig,` and `AuthorizedClientParseError` are removed.
  ([!2266])
- In [`tor-ptmgr`], `PtClientMethod` is now exported from the top-level.
  ([5774dd456265ef4cb8771342538a07ba76e5a5d9])

### RPC development
- Expose the OS errno of the FFI error types that have one. ([!2311])
- Fix typos in an FFI comment. ([!2310])
- Always re-encode requests and responses, and preserve unrecognized struct fields.
  ([#1491], [!2312])
- Expose the object ID for the session object. ([!2318])
- Use `JsonValue` to re-encode responses and requests.
  ([#1512], [#1511], [!2315])
- Add support for request handles in our FFI code. ([!2317])
- Add an unstable RPC method to list every RPC method. ([!2332])
- Build [`arti-rpc-client-core`] as a C dynamic library. ([!2331])
- Use more sophisticated handling for `ConnectionError`s in `arti-rpcserver`.
  ([#1517], [!2335])
- New `slotmap-careful` crate to use when we mustn't re-use keys. ([!2298])
- Rename various identifiers in our FFI code. ([!2344])
- Use the new `slotmap-careful` instead of `generational-arena` in
  `arti-rpcserver`. ([#1282], [!2343])
- Implement RPC method delegation support. ([#1523], [!2342])
- Allow simultaneous calls to `arti_rpc_handle_wait()`.
  ([#1532], [!2360])

### Relay development
- Add initial support for relay configuration. ([#1534], [!2352])

### Internal cleanup and refactoring
- Major refactoring to the `tor-proto` circuit reactor code,
  which simplifies the implementation and will enable us to support
  opportunistic packing for [proposal 340].
  Introduce `StreamPollSet` for polling streams in priority order.
  ([!2285], [#1513], [!2319], [!2334])
- Refactoring in our key management code to prevent accidental misuse
  of relative key paths. ([#1494], [!2291])
- Refactor `KeyedFuturesUnordered` so that the underlying futures
  are accessible. ([!2321])
- Allow access to the inner streams of `StreamPollSet`,
  refactor `StreamMap`. ([#1421], [!2326], [!2333])
- Make `GuardMgr` mandatory throughout our circuit management code.
  ([#1465], [!2339], [!2347])
- Encapsulate flow-control into a separate object,
  abstracting away the difference between window-based (legacy) flow control and
  xon-based ([proposal 324]) flow control. ([!2340], [!2358])
- Introduce a `PeekableStream` trait to get rid of redundant buffering.
  ([!2345])

### Onion service development
- Implement hidden service restricted discovery mode (previously known as
  "client authorization"). ([#1292], [!2266], [!2336], [!2316])
- Add support for live-reloading the restricted discovery configuration.
  ([#1505], [!2329], [!2353], [!2369])
- Provide an MPSC queue with memory quota tracking. ([#351], [!2292])
- Make arrangements in `tor-memquota` for memory tracking to be optional,
  and gate `MemoryQuotaTracker::new` behind the `memquota` feature.
  ([!2351])

### Minor features
- Stop requiring the TRANSPORT key in pluggable transport STATUS messages.
  ([#1488], [!2307])
- In [`fs-mistrust`], add a `CheckedDir::metadata()` function
  for retrieving file metadata.
  ([72c3a1a661284844806b34e9ca5e81a43b8d0913], [!2324])
- In [`tor-ptmgr`], make managed pluggable transports optional.

- Add an `InertTorClient` for accessing client state. ([#1496], [!2370],
  [!2314])
- Move `tor_async_utils::oneshot` into a new [`oneshot-fused-workaround`] crate.
  ([!2371], [!2383])

### Testing
- Make the `hsc` subcommand documentation serve as a test case. ([!2304])
- In the expected output of the CLI tests,
  match any number of lines in the `-c` help.
  ([#1509], [!2313])
- Fix broken reference to `apt-install` script in the Shadow integration tests.
  ([!2309])
- Add a Shadow integration test for restricted discovery mode. ([#1292],
  [!2272])
- Don't explicitly set `storage.keystore.enabled` in the Shadow CI tests.
  ([222b0eae48ae88d1a64cf5f0c11e662bf61dda4d])
- Test `cbindgen` correctness in CI. ([#1502], [!2320], [!2322], [!2330])
- Add `LogState` tests in `tor-log-ratelim`. ([!2349])
- Fix `arti_socket_closed` RPC test, which was previously flakey on OSX.
  ([#1510], [!2348])
- Add an arti obfs4 managed pluggable transport client and a tor obfs4
  server to the Shadow CI tests. ([#1538], [!2355])
- Temporarily disable a flaky configuration watcher test. ([!2364])
- Add circuit reactor test for stream handling fairness. ([!2365])
- Rewrite the `hsc` tests using `InertTorClient`.
  ([#1496], [1d3e59f2e9572a9710de2c2a9c925c5c38a6874c])
- Set the `COLUMNS` env var in the CLI tests.
  ([#1574], [f1779cfbb3e27b04ba3cca9206170f1e1ea904db])

### Documentation
- Remove obsolete documentation from [`tor-proto`]. ([!2366])
- Discourage use of `tor_rtmock_test_with_*` macros. ([!2372])

### Infrastructure
- Add a few more Tor employees to exclude from our acknowledgments. ([!2306])
- Remove the no-longer-necessary `--cfg docsrs` flag from our rustdoc invocation.
  ([!2308])
- Fix handling of items ending in `;` in `check_doc_features`
  maintenance script. ([!2316])
- Use the `via-cargo-install-in-ci` maintenance script to cache `grcov`
  in the `coverage-aggregated` job. ([!2325])
- Add initial support for building an Arti deb package. ([!2323], [!2367])
- Add script for testing without any features enabled.
  ([7a9bf49870533cc052b12680336f067f77d87b34])
- Run tests of every crate, with all features disabled. ([!2350])
- Explicitly specify the deployment target of macOS to 10.7
  to fix the failing `build-repro-macos` job.
  ([#1394], [#1507], [!2377], [!2346])
- Rename "Sponsor 101" to "Project 101". ([!2379])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes
- Make `arti hss onion-name` return a non-zero status if the service doesn't
  exist. ([!2305])
- Use `std::backtrace` instead of the [`backtrace`] crate. ([!2301])
- Add missing `docsrs` `cfg_attr` to fix a `cargo doc` warning. ([!2337])
- Resolve `unreachable_patterns` warnings from nightly. ([!2338])
- Make `blind_keypair` build without the `hsv3-client` feature.
  ([#1504], [!2341])
- Move `Qty` to [`tor-basic-utils`] as `ByteQty` and significantly improve it.
  ([!2363])
- Move `stream_peek` to [`tor-async-utils`]. ([!2362], [!2357])
- Various typo fixes in comments and messages. ([!2380])

# Arti 1.2.6 â€” 1 August 2024

Arti 1.2.6 continues development on onion service client authorization,
the RPC subsystem, and relay infrastructure.

### Security fixes

- Update `openssl` to avoid undefined behavior in `MemBio::get_buf`.
  ([RUSTSEC-2024-0357], [TROVE-2024-009], [#1495], [!2276])

### Major bugfixes

- When opening a SQLite directory cache in read-only mode, do not attempt to
  create it. This bug would sometimes prevent Arti from starting correctly
  when running multiple processes at once.
  ([#1497], [!2283])

### RPC development

- Initial work on a [wrapper library][arti-rpc-client-core]
  for invoking Arti RPC functionality from other processes.
  ([!2270], [!2277], [!2279])
- Initial work on [FFI support][arti-rpc-client-core-header]
  for invoking Arti RPC functionality from other languages.
  ([#737], [!2273])
- Clean up the RPC method dispatch implementation,
  remove some unneeded functions, and refactor the syntax
  for declaring error types. ([!2284])

### Relay development

- Infrastructure work for out-of-memory prevention.
  ([#351], [!2280], [!2281])

### Onion service development

- New `arti hsc` command for managing client state and keys for connecting
  to onion services. ([#1281], [#1291], [!2212], [!2257])
- Support parsing client restricted discovery (a.k.a. "client authorization") keys
  from C Tor's `descriptor:x25519:<base32-encoded-x25519-public-key>` key format.
  ([!2246])
- Ensure that `hsc` subcommand can build correctly with unusual combinations
  of features. ([!2254])
- Remove some unused code for publishing and authentication support.
  ([!2251])
- Add an `OnionServiceBuilder` API; deprecate `OnionService::new()`.
  ([#1490], [!2262])

### Minor features

- The obsolete and unused "TAP" keys are now optional
  when parsing network documents.
  This is phase one of [our plan][prop350] to eventually remove them entirely.
  ([!2227], [prop350])
- New `TorClient::wait_for_stop` method, for code that needs to wait
  until a TorClient instance has definitely shut down.
  ([#1418], [!2259], [!2278])
- In `tor-netdoc`, expose fields from `AnnotatedRouterDesc` and
  `RouterAnnotation` when `dangerous-expose-struct-fields is set.
  ([#1469], [!2213])

### Testing

- Exclude `maint` and `examples` from coverage reports. ([!2256])
- More tests throughout RPC codebase. ([!2264])
- Improvements and clean-ups to circuit reactor tests. ([!2287])
- CLI tests for the `arti hss` and `arti hsc` subcommands. ([#1250], [!2275])

### Documentation

- Clarify meaning of `peer_cert` in `UnverifiedChannel`. ([!2260])
- Improve documentation for mocked time in `tor-rtmock`. ([!2286])

### Infrastructure

- Improvements in release process and utilities for managing the changelog.
  ([!2240])
- Fix gitlab CI to always use `amd64` architecture images.
  Previously, it would sometimes choose a docker image for the wrong
  architecture. ([!2249])
- Split and refactor reproducible-build CI job. ([!2252])
- Improvements to script for detecting crate ownership problems.
  ([#1485], [!2255])
- Script to make sure that every crate has a valid set of crates.io
  categories. ([#1481], [!2256])
- Move our commonly used rust maintenance scripts to a separate repository,
  imported with `git-subtree`. ([#1300], [!2267])
- In gitlab CI, pin the compiler version we use to build cargo-audit
  and some other tools. ([!2289], [!2290])


### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

- Remove an unused constant from `equix`. ([!2243])
- Suppress and resolve a few warnings about documentation and dead code.
  ([!2244])
- Fix parsing time-periods from "key slug" identifiers. ([!2248])
- Fix error messages related to filesystem access failures,
  so that they do not all erroneously claim to be permissions failures.
  ([#1473], [!2253])
- Return correct error type when trying to extend a circuit via `ntor` to a
  relay with no known RSA identity. ([!2261])
- Fix a bug in the implementation of
  `ArtiNativeKeystore::contains()` that caused it to always return false.
  ([#1492], [!2274])
- Fixes for various new warnings from the nightly version of `clippy`.
  ([!2288])
- Disallow the error-prone `Path::exists()` function in our code,
  and use `try_exists()` instead. ([#1493], [!2293])

# Arti 1.2.4 â€” 5 June 2024

Arti 1.2.4 continues development on onion services,
and on the RPC subsystem.

This release restores the `faravahar` directory authority, which has a new
location and keys.

We have also fixed two-medium security issues, tracked as [TROVE-2024-005]
and [TROVE-2024-006], respectively, and a number of other, smaller bugs.

[TROVE-2024-005] affects hidden service circuits using non-default vanguard
configurations (where the vanguard mode is set to 'disabled' or 'full'),
causing hidden service circuits to be built from circuit stubs that are
incompatible with the circuit target, and to have an incorrect length.

[TROVE-2024-006] affects hidden services and clients using non-default
vanguard configurations, where the vanguard mode is set to 'disabled', or that
have the `vanguards` feature compiled out. In some circumstances, this bug can
lead to building hidden service circuits that contain the same relay in
multiple positions.

Both issues make users of this code more vulnerable to traffic analysis when
running or accessing onion services.

### Network updates

- Restore the `faravahar` directory authority, with new location and keys.
  ([!2175])

### Major bugfixes

- Ensure that `DataWriter::close()` actually closes its associated stream.
  Previously, this `close()` method would have no effect until the
  `DataReader` was also dropped. ([#1368], [!2170])
- Fix a bug where the vanguard circuit stub selection code would fail to ensure
  that the last two hops of the selected circuit stub are different from the
  circuit target. ([#1417], [!2167], [!2181])
- Fix a medium-severity issue causing the hidden service circuit pool code to
  ignore the configured vanguard mode.
  This is also tracked as [TROVE-2024-005]. ([#1424], [!2168])
- Use `HasRelayIds::has_any_relay_id_from` to check for relay equality
  when checking if a circuit contains duplicate relays. ([!2181])
- Fix a medium-severity issue, which would, in some circumstances, cause
  hidden service circuits to be built without applying the necessary same-hop
  restrictions.
  This is also tracked as [TROVE-2024-006]. ([#1425], [!2179])

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- The `Channel` type in `tor-proto` has been significantly refactored:
  it is now always wrapped in an explicit `Arc`, it no longer implements
  `Sink` on its own, and it can no longer be used to send raw cells
  from outside the `tor-proto` crate. ([!2163])
- `HsCircPool::reconfigure` has been removed
- `VanguardConfig` and `VanguardConfigBuilder` are now reexported from
  the root of the `tor-guardmgr` crate. ([!2146])
- `SshKeyData` is now an opaque type
- `SshKeyData::into_public` and `SshKeyData::into_private` have been removed

### Deprecated functionality

- The `arti-hyper` example crate is now deprecated and unmaintained.
  ([!2127])

### Onion service development

- Major refactoring to reduce technical debt in key manager code.
  ([#1362], [#1367], [!2131], [!2141])
- Address various pending "TODO" items in the vanguard code.
  ([!2139])
- Adjust terminology for vanguard stub circuits. ([#1339], [!2161])
- Add tests for vanguard configuration, and configuration backend logic as
  needed to simplify some of the vanguard configuration code. ([!2146])

### RPC development

- Expose methods on TorClient to get and observe the status of the client
  object. ([#1384], [!2110], [!2130])
- Infrastructure to allow the RPC system to interact with SOCKS streams,
  provide them with context, and name them as RPC objects.
  ([!2143])
- Based on difficulties encountered with earlier RPC development,
  add an improved facility for RPC methods that can be invoked internally
  without serializing their inputs and outputs. ([#1403], [!2152])
- Enforce consistent style and formatting on RPC method names. ([#823], [!2149])
- Other miscellaneous lower-level improvements to the RPC type
  system. ([!2124], [!2140], [!2142])

### Other major features

- If the circuit manager has retired all of its circuits,
  unconditionally retire all the circuits from the hidden service circuit pool.
  ([!2168])

### Testing

- Improved test layout in `tor-keymgr`. ([#1363], [!2125])
- Automate enforcement of our convention that scripts not be named with
  their implementation languages. ([!2153])
- Include script needed to generate `keymgr` test data. ([!2121])
- Add tests for vanguard state file serialization. ([!2167])
- Add a [Shadow] CI test involving an onion service that uses full vanguards.
  ([!2167])
- Add a test that ensures the hidden service circuit pool reads the vanguard mode
  from the configuration. ([!2168])
- Make the Shadow CI tests fail if any internal errors are reported in the logs.
  ([!2186])

### Documentation

- New example in arti-client for creating a one-hop circuit. ([!2148])
- Recommend `cargo --locked` in our examples, to encourage people
  to get audited versions of our dependencies. ([!2157])
- Clean up old changelogs to have a more uniform style, based on
  our updated `gen_md_links` script. ([!2126], [!2165])

### Infrastructure

- Disable automated Chutney tests in coverage CI. ([#1299], [!2120])
- Improve our `add_warning` script so that it can adjust our warnings during
  CI.  Previously we used a compiler `--cfg` flag for conditional warnings,
  but unrecognized `cfg` flags now provoke a warning. ([#1395], [!2129])
- Use `add_warning` to maintain the list of lints in our examples. ([!2132])
- Improved scripts to list our crates, and publish our crates,
  to make accidents less likely while
  we're trying to release.  ([#1390], [!2118], [!2138], [!2158])
- Improve our `gen_md_links` script to provide more uniform output,
  and generate its results in a more useful format. ([#1388], [!2126], [!2169])
- Ensure that our CI scripts delete unnecessary data on completion.
  (This helps keep us from running our infrastructure out of disk space
  and making the other gitlab users sad.) ([!2159])
- Adjust our license-checking code to accommodate
  license clarifications in `priority-queue` and `tinystr`.
  ([!2177])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

- Resolve several Clippy warnings from the latest version of Rust. ([!2128])
- Clarify control-flow in our (currently convoluted) circuit reactor code.
  ([!2122])
- Refactor to avoid most use of `cfg(fuzzing)`. ([#1395], [!2134])
- The `DataStream` type now has a method to wait for a connection to
  complete. ([489aa72d1eee8a56])
- Clarify or resolve several dead-code warnings. ([#1383], [!2151])
- Explicitly enforce maxima on SENDME windows.  (Formerly, we did this
  implicitly.)  ([#1383], [!2150])
- Avoid the appearance of an infinite loop in
  `engage_padding_activities`. ([!2164])
- Refactor the `Channel` type to be more explicitly `Arc`,
  better documented, and to have less information shared between its
  front-end and reactor pieces. ([!2163])
- Refactor the `poll_ready` method on `ChannelSender` to
  have a more conventional interface. ([!2171])
- Replace debug assertions with internal errors
  in the post-build checks for vanguard circuits,
  to prevent issues such as [TROVE-2024-003] and [TROVE-2024-004].
  ([!2167])
- When building vanguard circuits, ensure the target relay does not occur
  as one of the last two hops. ([!2186]]
- Upgrade to the latest versions of [priority-queue]. ([!2177])
- Validate the properties of the circuits retrieved
  from the hidden service circuit pool. ([97868349ed695ec8])
- Fix hidden service circuit stubs sometimes being unnecessarily extended
  when lite vanguards are in use. ([#1458], [!2183])
- Refactor vanguards configuration handling to be less error-prone.
  ([#1456], [!2183])

# Arti 1.2.3 â€” 15 May 2024

Arti 1.2.3 fixes a high-severity issue affecting onion services and clients
connecting to onion services with 'lite' vanguards (the default) enabled:
when building anonymizing circuits to or from an onion service
the circuit manager code would build the circuits with one hop too few.
This makes users of this code more vulnerable to some kinds of traffic analysis
when they run or visit onion services.

This release also fixes a medium-severity issue affecting 'full' vanguards.
With 'full' vanguards enabled, client HsDir circuits, client introduction
circuits and service rendezvous-circuits are extended with an extra hop to
minimize the linkability of the guard nodes.
In some circumstances, the circuit manager would build circuits with one
hop too few, making it easier for an adversary to discover the L2 and L3
guards of the affected clients and services.

In Arti 1.2.1 and earlier, vanguards were still an experimental feature, or
absent, so those versions are classified as "not affected", even though
downgrading does not fix the security problem.

### Major bugfixes

- Fix a high-severity issue affecting onion service circuits using 'lite'
  vanguards. Previously, with 'lite' vanguards enabled, any circuit to or from
  an onion service was one hop too short, making clients and services vulnerable
  to certain types of traffic analysis. This is also tracked as
  [TROVE-2024-003]. ([#1409])

- Fix a medium-severity issue affecting onion service circuits using 'full'
  vanguards. Previously, with 'full' vanguards enabled, *some* circuits to or from
  an onion service were one hop too short, making linkability attacks more
  likely to succeed.
  [TROVE-2024-004]. ([#1400])

# Arti 1.2.2 â€” 30 April 2024

Arti 1.2.2 continues improvements on previous releases,
by improving onion service security with [Vanguards].
This release also includes an as-yet-unused backend
to help resist memory-exhaustion attacks,
and numerous other smaller improvements.

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- Refactor our [`Relay`] code to move low-level information
  into a [`RelayDetails`] type.
  ([#504], [!2057], [!2073])
- The internal API for the RPC object system has been greatly revised.
  ([!2079])

### Network updates

- Update to use the new identity key
  for the `tor26` directory authority.
  ([!2080])

### Major bugfixes

- Fix an inadvertent recursion bug when converting
  ` TorAddrError` to `arti_client::Error`.
  ([#1379], [3f2dcaca31992018f825])
- Improve reliability of bootstrap status reporting.
  ([!2107])

### Onion service development

- Arti now supports [Vanguards] for improved security
  against guard discovery for onion service circuits.
  By default, we use the `vanguards-lite` algorithm;
  the `vanguards-full` algorithm can be configured.
  ([#1272], [#1273], [#1275], [#1340], [#1353], [#1364], [#1366],
  [!2075], [!2082], [!2083], [!2088], [!2090], [!2093], [!2099],
  [!2102], [!2104], [!2105], [!2109], [!2111])
- Export `KeyMgrBuilderError` as a public type,
  to help external code construct its own [`KeyMgr`].
  ([!2078])
- Initial implementation for
  an in-memory ephemeral key store, which will be useful
  in implementing ephemeral onion services.
  ([#1358], [!2076])
- Fix a bug that prevented reporting of onion service status updates.
  ([#1361], [!2086])
- Fix a bug that would cause onion service circuit pools
  to pre-build fewer circuits than actually desired.
  ([!2101])

### RPC development

- The RPC object system has been refactored to use `derive-deftly`
  and an improved system of method invocation.
  Together, these changes make it easier to write RPC methods,
  and allow support for RPC methods on generic types.
  ([#838], [#1380], [!2079], [!2084], [!2103])

### Other major features

- Convert to use [`figment`] instead of [`config-rs`]
  as our configuration backend,
  for improved error messages.
  ([#1267], [#1268], [!2041])
- New `tor-memquota` backend crate to keep track of our memory usage,
  and to help us react appropriately when we are out of memory.
  We will use this as part of our DoS-resistance system.
  ([#1381], [!2091], [!2100])


### Documentation

- Add cross-references to explain limitations of [`NetDir::by_ids`].
  ([#1365], [!2081])
- Fix a link to our Code of Conduct.
  ([!2085])
- Miscellaneous documentation fixes.
  ([!2087])
- Document some tricky assumptions and requirements in `tor-proto`'s
  circuit reactor code.
  ([#1373], [!2089])
- Improve documentation and license presence for our two
  LGPL-licensed crates.
  ([#1375], [!2094], [!2106])

### Testing

- Add high-level tests for pluggable transport configuration.
  ([#1333])

### Infrastructure

- Adjust our license-checking code to accommodate
  license clarifications in `rustls-webpki` and `option-ext`.
  ([!2070])
- Fix compilation breakage in our relaymsg fuzzing code.
  ([#1349], [!2069])
- Add an option to the `fuzz_it_all` script
  for it to run only against the static corups.
  ([#1350], [!2071])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

- Remove unused dependencies from several crates.
  ([!2068])
- Expose `BridgesConfig` from `TorClientConfig`
  so it can be inspected by other modules.
  ([c5a91130fff6af25])
- Refactor code for scheduling events in onion service code.
  ([#1259], [!2064])
- Update our code to use [`derive-deftly`],
  formerly called `derive-adhoc`.
  ([!2066])
- Refactor `same_relay_ids` to be automatically derived.
  ([!2072])
- Refactor `StreamMap`'s stream-counting code to be less
  error-prone.

# Arti 1.2.1 â€” 2 April 2024

Arti 1.2.1 continues development on onion services,
and adds several important security features.
More such improvements are on the way.
See [`doc/OnionService.md`] for instructions and caveats about running
onion services with Arti today.

This release also adds support for
[unmanaged pluggable transports][#755],
and begins work to improve Tor's relay cell protocol
with support for [packed and fragmented messages][prop340].

### New versioning policy

Starting with this version,
we are no longer independently tracking
breaking and non-breaking version changes
for the `arti-client` crate and each of the `tor-*` crates below it.
Instead, we will _assume_
that every release of these crates breaks API compatibility
with the one before, and update our semantic versioning accordingly.
(We will continue not to make gratuitous API compatibility breaks
on purpose.)

Previously, our efforts to track
which changes in these crates were breaking
and which were not
created a great deal of overhead in our development process,
and tended to be somewhat error-prone.

This change affects developers only; users should not be affected.
This does not affect crates already at version `1.x` or higher,
or published utility crates whose names don't start with `tor-` or `arti-`.

See [`doc/Semver.md`] for more information on this policy.
([#1005], [!2051])

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- Refactored `tor-config` to hide implementation details.
  This will eventually allow us to migrate from `config-rs`
  to a configuration provider with better error handling.
  ([!2040])
- Renamed several types in `tor-ptmgr`
  to reflect new support for unmanaged pluggable transports.
  ([d63d966d79f0f988])
- The `tor_circmgr::path` module is now crate-private.
  ([4c1eb94173521bc5])
- The [`Runtime`] trait now includes functionality for "coarse" time,
  backed (by default) by the [`coarsetime`] crate.
  We use these timestamps in cases
  where we need fast time checking more than precision.
  Putting them into `Runtime` lets us replace them with mock functions
  for testing purposes.
  ([!2050], [!2052])
- The `tor-cell` relay cell API is significantly revised.
  ([!2034], [!2045], [prop340])
- The `allow_stream_requests()` method in `tor-proto`
  now takes an extra argument.
  ([!2047])

### Onion service development

- Reorganize onion service code,
  to remove an unnecessary (and inconsistently used) internal module,
  to simplify needless imports,
  and to generally tidy up the implementation.
  ([#1212], [!2020])
- Avoid using `futures::oneshot`:
  our own `tor_basic_utils::oneshot` is safer to use
  when `select!` may be involved.
  ([95ed432c13c2c4b2])
- Design work for out-of-memory handling,
  which is necessary for onion service security.
  ([!1997])
- Onion services have now support a `max_concurrent_streams_per_circuit` option.
  ([#1124], [!2047])
- Initial implementation work
  for onion service [vanguards],
  which are needed to improve onion service security.
  This is not yet complete.
  ([#1272], [#1275], [#1276], [#1277], [#1340],
  [!2035], [!2038], [!2046], [!2049], [!2053])

### Other major features

- New relay cell decoding API, in order to eventually handle
  packed and fragmented messages.
  ([!2034], [!2045], [prop340])
- We now support unmanaged pluggable transports.
  Previously, Arti only supported _managed_ pluggable transports:
  that is, ones that it launched itself.
  Now you can configure Arti to use a pluggable transport
  running at a known SOCKS port.
  ([#755], [!2043])

### Documentation and examples

- Improve windows documentation in `fslock-guard` and `test-temp-dir`.
  ([!2011])
- More documentation for our internal build and release tools.
  ([!2028])
- Fixed broken links in the documentation for `NetParameters`.
  ([!2054])
- Fixed the disclaimer about onion services in our configuration file.
  ([!2055])

### Testing

- More unit tests in `fslock-guard`.
  ([!2013])
- More tests for `arti_client::address`.
  ([!2029])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

- We've fixed a bug in our arguments parser
  that previously caused `arti` to panic when run without arguments.
  ([#1311], [!2021])
- The `tor-checkable` module now uses checked time arithmetic,
  to avoid overflows or panics when extending tolerances.
  ([!2031])
- We now enforce Clippy's [`unchecked_duration_subtraction`] lint by default.
  ([#1304], [!2008])
- Refactor configuration watcher to receive a `Runtime`.
  Previously it took an entire `TorClient`, unnecessarily.
  ([!2017])
- We now ban `std::Path::display`,
  since it is lossy in an easy-to-overlook way.
  We've given it a `PathExt::display_lossy` implementation
  to be used instead.
  ([!2027])
- The `tor-bytes` module now behaves more sensibly
  (typically panicking)
  if someone tries to use `write_zeros` to extend a buffer beyond `usize::MAX`.
  Previously it might truncate its buffer.
  ([!2033])
- Refactoring and improvements on the `BackoffSchedule` logic.
  ([#1259], [!2024])
- Moved logic for picking relays into a new `tor-relay-selection` crate,
  to avoid duplicated code
  and the risk of missing necessary checks when picking or examining relays.
  ([#504], [#789], [!2002])
- Clarify implementation of onion service timeout calculation logic,
  to avoid possible confusion about the `hs_hops` variable.
  ([#1332], [!2044])
- Simplified logic and API for creating relay encryption layers.
  ([!2048])
- Various typo fixes in comments and messages. ([!2030], [!2032], [!2036])

# Arti 1.2.0 â€” 4 March 2024

Arti 1.2.0 continues work on support for running onion services.
You can now launch an onion service and expect it to run,
although you may well encounter bugs.

We have fixed a number of bugs and security issues,
and have made the `onion-service-service` feature non-experimental.

In the next releases, we will focus on implementing
the missing security features and on improving stability.

Don't rely on this onion service implementation for security yet;
there are a number of [missing security features]
we will need to develop before we can recommend them
for actual use.

See [`doc/OnionService.md`] for instructions and caveats.

### Major bugfixes

- Empty DATA messages are a way to inject an undetected traffic signal, so we
  now reject empty DATA messages, and prevent them from being constructed
  through the [`tor-cell`] API.  This is tracked as [TROVE-2024-001].
  ([!1981], [#1269])

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- In [`tor-circmgr`], `Error::GuardNotUsable`, `Error::CircTimeout`,
  and `Error::Protocol` now contain the process-unique identifier of the circuit
  that caused the error. ([!2003])
- In [`tor-hsclient`], remove `HsClientNickname` and the nickname argument from
  `HsClientDescEncKeypairSpecifier::new`. ([!1998], [#1283])
- In [`tor-hsrproxy`], add a `String` representing the error message to
  `ProxyConfigError::UnrecognizedTargetType`,
  `ProxyConfigError::InvalidTargetAddr`, `ProxyConfigError::InvalidPort`.
  ([!1973], [#1266])
- In [`tor-hsservice`], remove the unimplemented `max_concurrent_streams_per_circuit`
  configuration option from `OnionServiceConfigBuilder`.  We may implement and
  reinstate it in a future release. ([!1996])
- In [`tor-keymgr`], rename `KeyInfoExtractor` to `KeyPathInfoExtractor`.
  ([bd85bffd0a388f57])
- In [`tor-keymgr`], rename `{to,from}_component()` to `{to,from}_slug()`.
  ([1040df929f643a2f])

### Onion service development

- Improve the key manager APIs. ([!1952], [#1115])
- Add more context to [`tor-hsrproxy`] configuration error messages. ([!1973])
- Design an API for vanguards. ([!1970])
- Make the descriptor publisher conform with the specification, by periodically
  republishing the hidden service descriptor.  This fixes a serious reachability
  bug. ([!1971], [#1241], [#1280])
- Rotate old introduction point relays even if they are not working.
  ([72c021555e1095f1])
- Expire old on-disk introduction point state. ([!1977], [!1982], [#1198])
- Expose `HsNickname::new`. ([f3720ac2c0f16883])
- Design the client and service configuration, and a CLI subcommand, for hidden
  service client authorization. ([!1987])
- Improve the ergonomics of our key listing and removal APIs. ([!1988], [#1271])
- Include the `ArtiPath` in key path errors. ([!1960], [#1115])
- Improve circuit error logging by including the process-unique identifier of
  the circuit in error messages. ([!2003], [#1297])
- Improve status reporting from onion services. ([!1966], [#1083])
- Design an API for bandwidth rate limiting. ([!1965])
- Improve descriptor publisher error reporting. ([!1991])
- Remove the client nickname from onion service client key specifiers. ([!1998],
  [#1283])
- When reconfiguring an onion service, reject any changes that are inappropriate
  or would put the service in a bad state. ([!1996], [#1209])
- Remove the keystore directory configuration option, pending design work
  relating to RPC and multi-user Arti. ([!1995], [#1202])
- Mark `onion-service-service` and every feature it depends on as
  non-experimental. ([!1993], [#1182])
- Fix a bug that prevented the descriptor publisher from fully processing the
  results of publish tasks, causing it to republish the descriptor unnecessarily
  in some circumstances. ([!1983])

### Other major new features in our Rust APIs

- [`tor-persist`] now provides new `state_dir` APIs for instance iteration and
  expiry needed for onion service state expiry.  ([!1968], [#1163])

### Documentation and examples

- Fix the casing of our recognized key paths. ([1a900081e945679e])
- Minor updates to the release process. ([!1959], [!1963])
- Fix typos in the [`tor-guardmgr`] README. ([!1980])
- Reword the [`tor-keymgr`] README for clarity. ([489a2555f28daa6d])
- Update onion service documentation. ([!1994], [#1287])
- Clarify the onion service configuration instructions from
  `doc/OnionService.md`, remove unsupported "unix:" example. ([!1972], [#1266])

### Testing

- Improve replay log fork test. ([!1974], [!2010], [#1264])
- In the introduction point manager tests, avoid reusing the RNG seed.
  ([b515baf27f194470])
- Our [Shadow] CI tests now use the latest versions of `shadow` and `tgen`, and
  no longer pull `libigraph` from bullseye. ([!1958])
- Upgrade docker image for reproducible builds. ([!2016])
- Fix several tests on Windows. ([!2015])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

- Allow overriding `cargo` in [`semver-checks`]. ([83c29b0d805f908e])
- Introduce a [`list_crates_publish`] script. ([b03e5d5e11c52faf])
- Fix compilation with musl. ([!1961], [#1264])
- Add `fixup-features` to the main workspace, make various improvements to
  `fixup-features`, `check_toposort`, `list_crates`. ([!1969], [#1263])
- Use `std::default::Default` instead of [educe]'s `Default` in a number of
  places in preparation for the upgrade to educe 0.5. ([!1975], [#1257])
- Require the Fast and Stable flags as appropriate. ([!1976], [#1100])
- Refactor and improve error hinting in [`arti`] and [`arti-client`]. ([!1986],
  [#1165])
- Do not output ANSI escape codes when logging to file. ([!1999], [#1298])
- Upgrade our dependency on [curve25519-dalek] from 4.1.1 to 4.1.2. ([!2000])
- Upgrade to the latest versions of [event-listener], [rusqlite],
  [async-broadcast], [signature], [config]. ([!2001], [!2004], [!2451])
- Fix `ArtiPath` creation on Windows. ([!2012])
- Fix compilation and warnings on Windows. ([!2014], [!2009])
- Gate `RpcConfig` behind `rpc` feature. ([6c9e70e39ab279aa]])

# Arti 1.1.13 â€” 5 February 2024

Arti 1.1.13 continues work on support for running onion services.
You can now launch an onion service and expect it to run.

We have fixed a number of bugs.  The user experience is still not
great, and the onion-service-service feature is still experimental.
We have reorganised the on-disk state and key storage, to make it more
sensible; we hope (but don't promise!) it's now the final layout.
Don't rely on this onion service implementation for security yet;
there are a number of [missing security features]
we will need to develop before we can recommend them
for actual use.

See `doc/OnionService.md` for instructions and caveats.

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- [`tor-hsclient`]\: Replaced `HsClientKeyRole`,
  `HsClientSecretKeySpecifier` with `HsClientDescEncKeypairSpecifier`.
  Renamed `HsClientSpecifier` to `HsClientNickname`.
  ([!1864], [!1931])
- [`tor-hscrypto`]\: `AesOpeKey::encrypt` now takes a
  `SrvPeriodOffset`; Replaced `TimePeriodOffset` with
  `SrvPeriodOffset`; Removed `TimePeriod::offset_within_period`.
  ([!1904], [#1166])
- [`tor-netdir`]\: `hs_dirs_download` parameters changed;
  `hs_intro_*_lifetime` parameters renamed.
  ([!1903], [!1904], [#1254])

### Onion service development

- Complete overhaul of the way the hidden service code stores non-key
  persistent state.  Pathnames have changed as a result.
  ([!1853], [#1183], [!1941])
- Many improvements to keystore, key and `KeySpecifier` handling,
  including incompatible changes to on-disk key paths.
  ([!1864], [!1863], [!1883], [#1260], [!1949], [#1074], [!1948])
- Fix "service fails after approx 12 hours" bug.
  ([#1242], [!1901])
- Fix time period processing bugs including `HSS: "internal error"
  "current wallclock time not within TP?!"`.
  ([#1155], [#1166], [#1254], [!1903], [!1904], [!1914])
- Correctly rate-limit descriptor publication.
  ([!1951])
- Fixes to services shutdown.
  ([!1875], [!1895], [!1897], [#1236], [!1899], [!1917], [!1921])
- Improve error and corner case handling in descriptor publisher.
  ([!1861])
- Work on expiring keys: we expire descriptor keys now (although we
  don't actually properly delete all keys when we need to, yet).
  ([!1909])
- Only choose Stable relays for introduction points.
  ([!1884], [#1240], [#1211])
- Better handling of introduction point establishment failures.
  ([!1889], [!1915])
- Better handling of anomalous situations (including excessive
  requests) on introduction circuits.
  ([#1188], [#1189], [!1892], [!1916])
- Tolerate `INTRO_ESTABLISHED` messages with (unknown) extensions.
  ([!1898])
- Correct and improve various timing and tuning parameters.
  ([!1911], [!1924])
- Improve status reporting from hidden services.
  ([!1902])
- Public API of `tor-hsservice` crate overhauled.
  ([#1227], [#1220], [!1887])
- Mark lower-level hs-service features non-experimental.
  ([!1908])
- Defend against partial writes of introduction point replay log
  entries.
  ([!1920])
- Corrections to error handling, including to handling of introduction
  point failures, and attempts to launch the same service
  concurrently.
  ([!1906], [#1237], [#1225], [#1255])
- Detect and reject configurations with onion services, when
  onion-service-server support has been compiled out.
  ([!1885], [#1184])
- Temporarily disable parsing of AF_UNIX socket addresses (which
  aren't implemented right now anyway).
  ([!1886])
- Rate limit one log message, downgrade one, and remove another.
  ([!1871], [!1951])
- Add higher-level documentation to tor-hsservice (and fix a broken
  docs link).
  ([!1918], [!1945])
- Hide the `OnionServiceState` type.
  ([!1946], [#1261])
- Many internal cleanups including much triage of TODO comments in the code.
  ([!1859], [!1862], [!1861], [!1868], [!1866], [!1863], [!1870], [!1874], [!1872], [!1869], [!1876], [!1867], [!1873], [!1877], [!1878], [!1875], [!1879], [!1882], [!1881], [!1880], [!1894], [!1888], [!1887], [!1896], [!1864], [!1951])

### Other major new features in our Rust APIs

- New `fslock-guard` crate for on-disk lockfiles which can be deleted,
  and which have a Rust API that returns a guard object.
  ([fslock!15], [!1900], [!1910])
- `tor-persist` has a `Slug` type which is used for nicknames, key
  paths, etc., unifying the rules used for different kinds of name.
  ([!1912], [#1092], [#1193], [!1926], [!1929], [!1922], [!1933], [#1092]).
  ([!1931], [!1934])
- `tor-persist` has `StateDirectory` for handling persistent state
  relating to particular instances of a facility (used for hidden
  services).
  ([!1853], [#1205], [!1913], [#1163], [!1935])

### Documentation and examples

- New examples using `hyper v1`.
  ([!1845])
- Fix a broken link.
  ([!1938])

### Testing

- New `test-temp-dir` crate for convenient handling of temporary files
  in tests.
  ([!1925])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

- `fs-mistrust`: Expose `CheckedDir::verifier`
  and provide `CheckedDir::make_secure_dir`.
  ([!1927], [!1928])
- Instructions for building `arti-extra` in `tests/shadow/README.md`.
  ([!1891])

# Arti 1.1.12 â€” 9 January 2024

Arti 1.1.12 continues work on support for running onion services.
You can now launch an onion service and expect it to run,
though the user experience leaves a lot to be desired.
Don't rely on this onion service implementation for security yet;
there are a number of [missing security features]
we will need to develop before we can recommend them
for actual use.

### Breaking changes

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- In `tor_dirmgr`, rename the `cache_path` parameter to `cache_dir`
  for consistency. ([!1789])
- In `tor-error`, the `ErrorReport` trait is now sealed.
  ([00903e22bb978295])
- Change the domain name used to tag our extended SSH key types.
  This will break any keys created using earlier releases,
  though it is unlikely that anybody actually managed to do so.
  ([#1108], [!1838])
- In `tor-netdoc`, `HsDescBuilder::auth_clients` now takes an
  `Option`, to distinguish the case where no clients are allowed from
  the case where all clients are allowed. ([#1019], [!1840])

### Onion service development

- Fix a set of bugs bug that caused onion services to upload far too
  many descriptors. ([#1130], [#1142], [!1787], [!1806])
- Improve reporting of descriptor upload failures. ([#1132],
  [f26b00b3179a7e13], [1990bbdffd87abaa], [!1799])
- Ensure that the list of published introduction points is
  recorded correctly.  ([#1097], [!1805])
- Implement persistence for introduction point information,
  so that onion services can restart with the same introduction points
  and behave correctly. ([#967], [!1782])
- Refactor key manager code to prevent the creation of invalid
  `KeySpecifier`s, and extend the `KeySpecifier` macro to also
  generate `KeyInfoExtractor` implementations for extracting
  information out of `&KeyPath`s. ([#1127], [f7772f127e895d96])
- Add lower-level support for deleting expired keys and associated information.
  ([#1043], [!1784], [!1796])
- Onion services can now be stopped, started, or reconfigured while
  arti is running. ([#1089], [!1798])
- Implement an API for onion services to report their
  status. ([#1083], [!1797], [!1808])
- Produce useful, rate-limited log messages on certain kinds of
  onion service failures. ([!1809])
- Warn on some onion service configurations that are unlikely to be
  intentional. ([!1822])
- Add documentation for how to run an onion service, in
  [`doc/OnionService.md`].  This documentation also records areas where
  the implementation is lacking, and notes areas where the current
  process has bad usability. ([!1825], [!1826], [!1841])
- Fix a bug that would occur when trying to create an onion service
  descriptor for a time period that had not yet begun. ([#1155],
  [!1828])
- Always log the onion service's `.onion` address, when starting with
  `log_sensitive_information` enabled. ([!1830])
- Ensure that no extra features beyond `onion-service-service` are
  needed in `arti` to enable onion service support. ([49ece08bafc115ce])
- Use our regular sub-builder pattern for key-manager configuration,
  so that default option values can be omitted. ([4d7aeeab57577c98])
- Various improvements to descriptor publisher error
  handling. ([#1129], [!1812], [!1821])
- Record a replay-log of incoming `INTRODUCE2` requests, to prevent
  replay attacks. ([!1824])
- Add a CLI for learning the `.onion` address for a given onion service.
  ([#1071], [!1837])
- Refactor the `KeySpecifier` macro and its implementations to improve
  usability and reduce the API surface. ([#1151], [#1147], [#1126],
  [!1851])

### Other major features

- Arti now supports the [`ntor_v3`] circuit extension handshake, which
  enables clients to send circuit parameters to the relays on their paths.
  ([#1084], [!1766])

### Documentation

- Improve documentation of state and cache directories. ([!1789])
- Improve internal documentation about how we implement the onion
  service specifications. ([!1795], [!1813])
- Various typo fixes. ([!1852])

### Testing

- Fix an (unreached) bug in test_tmp_dir code. ([!1792])
- Include an onion service in our [Shadow] CI tests. ([!1827])


### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

- Various cleanups enabled by our transition to requiring
  Rust 1.70.  ([!1785])
- Refactor high-level reconfiguration code so that it sends its
  configuration to each of a set of modules, rather than hardcoding a
  list of functions to call. ([1ac515c183bf8c1d])
- The `traits` module is now unconditionally present in
  the `tor-llcrypto` crate. ([!1815])
- In `tor-error`, the `ErrorReport` is now implemented for `dyn StdError`,
  which allows us to use it with `anyhow::Error`. ([#1157], [!1818])
- Fix a busy-loop that would occur if a channel was due to expire in
  less than a second, and another race condition when expiring
  channels. ([!1834])
- In `tor-cell`, `{Any}RelayCell` has been renamed to `{Any}RelayMsgOuter`,
  in order to prepare for work on [proposal 340]. This name is a placeholder;
  eventually, there will be a followup renaming. ([#775], [!1839], [!1840])
- Improve the output of `tokio`'s tracing feature when used with our
  `tor-rtcompat` wrappers. ([!1843])
- Expose a `dir_mgr_config()` accessor from `TorClientConfig`.
  ([#1175], [!1847])

# Arti 1.1.11 â€” 4 December 2023

Arti 1.1.11 continues work on support for running onion services.
Onion services are now working in our testing, and we expect we'll
have something testable by others in our next release.

Arti 1.1.11 also increases our MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version)
to 1.70, in accordance with our [MSRV policy].

### Breaking changes

- Arti now requires Rust 1.70 or later. ([!1773])

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- The `LockStatus` type in tor-persist is now `#[must_use]`. ([#1753])
- The `tor-dirclient` crate now exposes `http::Error` from
  http 1.0. ([c5b386fb1009a1d9])
- The `tor-dirclient` crate's `RequestError` type now includes status text
  from the directory server, to help diagnose problems. ([!1780])
- We've upgraded to the latest versions of [dalek-cryptography].  This
  is a breaking change to every internal Arti API that takes a
  curve25519 or ed25519 key as its input. ([#808], [!1767])
- In `tor-cell`, `HandshakeType` is now used in several places
  in place of `u16`. ([5d7f70c0fe515aee])

### Onion service development

- Correct our handling of BEGIN and END messages to bring them
  into conformance with the C Tor implementation and the specification.
  ([#1077], [!1694], [!1738])
- In our key manager, use macros to define key specifiers, instead of
  repeating the same boilerplate code. ([#1069], [#1093], [!1710],
  [!1733])
- Refactoring and refinement on the definitions of onion-service-related
  errors. ([!1718], [!1724], [!1750], [!1751], [!1779])
- Add a "time-store" mechanism for (as correctly as possible) storing and loading
  future timestamps, even in the presence of system clock skew. ([!1723], [!1774])
- Implement a replay-log backend to prevent INTRODUCE replay attacks
  against onion services. ([!1725])
- Improved encoding for key-denotators in the key manager. ([#1063],
  [#1070], [!1722])
- Allow a single key to have more than one denotator in its path.
  ([#1112], [!1747])
- Use an order-preserving-encryption back-end to generate
  monotonically increasing revision counters for onion service
  descriptors.  We do this to ensure a reproducible series of counters
  without leaking our clock skew.  ([#1053], [!1741], [!1744])
- Deprecate key types for INTRODUCE-based authentication:
  C tor has never implemented this, and we do not plan to implement it
  without additional specification work. ([#1037], [!1749])
- When establishing an introduction point, send the `intro_dos`
  extension as appropriate. ([#723], [!1740])
- Added conversion functions and initial persistence support for
  introduction point keys. ([!1756])
- Start work on introduction point persistence. ([!1755], [!1765])
- Make a `Builder` type for key managers. ([#1114], [!1760])
- Revert to our intended configuration format for onion service proxy rules.
  ([#1058], [!1771])
- Resolve miscellaneous "TODO" items throughout the onion service
  code. ([#1066], [!1728], [!1731], [!1732], [!1742])

### Client features

- Backend and API code for the "ntor-v3" circuit-extension handshake.
  This handshake adds the ability to send additional options
  from the client to the relay when creating or extending a circuit,
  and will eventually be used to negotiate protocol features like
  RTT-based congestion control and UDP-over-Tor support.
  ([!1720], [!1739])

### Testing

- Simplify the usage of time-simulating mock runtimes.
  ([ee96e5e454ba5db2])
- Use time-simulating mock runtimes in more circuit-manager tests, to
  make them more reliable. ([#1090], [!1727])
- Add a `spawn_join` method to mock runtimes, to simplify
  tests. ([!1746])
- Prototype a "testing temp dir" facitility to ensure that temporary
  directories used in tests can be persistent if desired, and that
  they live for long enough. ([!1762])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

- Fix various warnings from Clippy. ([!1719])
- Solve a bug that prevented `Conversation::send_message` from working.
  ([#1085], [!1726])
- Upgrade to version 4 of the `clap` option-parsing library.
  ([!1735])
- New backend to generate rate limited problem reports without
  spamming the logs.  ([#1076], [!1734], [!1752])
- Correct our decisions about sending Content-Length on HTTP
  requests. Previously we had sent it unconditionally. ([#1024],
  [!1671])
- Add directory-listing and file-deletion support to
  `fs-mistrust::CheckedDir`. ([#1117], [!1759])

# Arti 1.1.10 â€” 31 October 2023

Arti 1.1.10 continues work on support for onion services in Arti.
At last, we can (technically) run as an onion service... though
not yet in a useful way. (Onion services don't yet recover correctly
after a restart, outdated keys are not removed,
and we are missing other important security features.)

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- The [`IoErrorExt`] trait in [`tor-basic-utils`] is now
  sealed. ([!1654])
- The [`Requestable`] trait in [`tor-dirclient`] is now sealed,
  and most of its members are now private. ([!1679])
- In [`tor-cell`], stream and circuit IDs are now inherently non-zero.
  To represent an ID that might be zero on the wire, we now use
  `Option<StreamId>` or `Option<CircId>`. ([#1080], [!1697])
- In [`tor-cell`], `CREATE2` handshake types are no longer raw
  `u16` values. ([!1703])
- In [`tor-cert`], `encode_and_sign` now returns an
  `Ed25519EncodedCert` rather than a raw `Vec<u8>`. ([!1702])

### Onion service development

- The `arti` binary can now be configured to invoke the code that
  launch onion services, and the code that proxies them to local
  ports. ([!1644])
- Configuration support for onion services, and for the `rproxy`
  facility that directs incoming onion service connections to local
  services. ([!1638], [!1640])
- The introduction points are now exposed by the code that manages
  them to the code that publishes onion service descriptors. ([!1636],
  [!1645])
- Implement reconfiguration support in the lower level onion service
  code. ([!1651])
- Temporarily changed the configuration format for onion service ports
  to work around [a bug in `config-rs`]. ([21605d2c9e601c3a])
- As-yet-unused code to build a list of authorized clients. ([#1051],
  [!1642])
- Auto-generate missing keys rather than failing when we are
  about to publish. ([!1688])
- Log onion service Ids when they are created, so we can test them.
  ([!1689])
- Move responsibility for generating descriptor signing key certificates
  into `tor-hsservice` from `tor-netdoc`; refactor accordingly.
  ([!1702])
- Resolve a number of pending "TODO" items in [`tor-proto`] affecting
  the onion service implementation. ([!1658])
- Resolve a number of pending "TODO" items in [`tor-dirclient`] affecting
  the onion service implementation. ([!1675])
- Sort introduction point lists by ntor public key before publication,
  to avoid leaking information. ([#1039], [!1674])
- Numerous bugfixes, cleanups, and backfills found during testing and
  integrating the pieces of the onion service
  implementation. ([!1634], [!1637], [!1659], [!1673], [!1682],
  [!1684], [!1686], [!1695], [!1711])


### Client features

- Arti can now be configured to listen for connections on multiple arbitrary
  addressesâ€”not just `localhost`. ([!1613])

### Key manager

- The key manager code now has improved support for generating
  keypairs, keys with derived data, and other structures needed for
  onion services. ([!1653])
- The key manager now encodes whether a key is private or public in its
  file extension. ([!1672])
- The key manager now disallows path components that could lead
  (under some programming errors) to directory traversal. ([!1661])
- We can now list keys by path and type; this is important so that
  we can identify disused keys and eventually expire them. ([!1677])

### Documentation and examples

- Correct our example for how to connect to onion services. ([!1653])
- Update download location in `download-manager` example.
  ([!1691])

### Infrastructure

- Our release scripts and processes are now more robust against
  several kinds of mistake that have frustrated previous releases,
  including crates that change only when their dependencies get new
  versions, accidental inclusion of wildcard dependencies, and
  dependencies on unpublished crates.  ([!1646])
- Clean up use of `after_script` in our CI to behave more sensibly.
  ([#1061], [!1663])


### Testing

- Even-more-improved support for tests that depend on a simulated view
  of the passage of time. ([!1639], [!1650])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

- Refactored the key derivation code for relay cryptography. ([!1629])
- Work around [a bug in `FusedFuture for oneshot::Receiver`] that made
  it dangerous to `select!` on a `oneshot::Receiver` to detect if the
  sender is dropped.  ([#1059], [!1656], [futures-rs#2455](https://github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/issues/2455))
- Fix handling for escape sequences when talking to a
  pluggable transport. ([!1584])
- Major refactoring and simplifications on the explicit closing of
  pending incoming streams, to prevent double-close bugs and related
  panics. ([#1065], [!1678], [!1681])
- Refactor implementation of ISO-8601 time parsing in descriptors.
  ([#751], [!1693])
- Renamed the function in `tor-hsclient` to launch a circuit to an
  onion service to be less confusing. The old name remains but is
  deprecated. ([#1078], [!1700])
- Do not advertise or accept non-required compression encodings
  when making anonymized requests to an onion service directory:
  to do so is a fingerprinting vector.
  ([#1062], [cfe641613e6b6f4f])
- Use the new typed handshake-type codes when building onion service
  descriptors.  ([!1712])

# Arti 1.1.9 â€” 2 October 2023

Arti 1.1.9 continues work on support for onion services in arti.
The pieces are now (mostly) connected; the next month of development
will see extensive testing, bugfixing, and refinement.

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- In `tor-hsclient` and `tor-netdoc`'s APIs, secret authentication
  keys are now handled as `HsClientDescKeypair`, rather than as
  individual keys.
- In `tor-circmgr`, the `NoExit` error now includes a possible country
  code.
- In `tor-ptmgr`, `ClientTransportGaveError` have been renamed to
  `TransportGaveError`.

### Onion service development

- The onion service descriptor publisher is now in conformance with
  our spec with respect to how it handles time periods.  ([!1564])
- The descriptor publisher now runs in parallel, so that a blocked
  upload doesn't prevent successful uploads from succeeding. ([!1580])
- The descriptor publisher now includes correct retry and timing
  logic. ([!1592], [!1623])
- The introduction point manager code is now able to integrate with
  the descriptor publisher. ([!1575], [!1576], [!1577], [!1578], [!1603])
- The descriptor publisher code is now integrated with the key
  management system. ([#1042], [!1615])
- The introduction point manager is now integrated with the code that
  accepts user requests via introduction points. ([!1597], [!1598])
- The code responsible for selecting and maintaining introduction
  points is now more robust in the presence of relay selection
  failure. ([!1585])
- We now have a `tor-hsrproxy` crate, to handle running an onion
  service that directs incoming connections to local ports.  Users
  will need this if they want their onion services to run in a
  separate process and not use Rust. ([01f954d3782df57a], [!1622])
- Added configuration logic for onion services. ([!1557], [!1599],
  [!1605], [!1611])
- The `downgrade_dependencies` script now honors the `$CARGO` variable.
  ([!1596])
- We now use a keypair type for `hs_ntor` secret keys. ([#1030],
  [!1590])
- There is now a set of (not working yet!) APIs to actually launch and
  run onion services, by invoking the necessary pieces of the backend,
  and pass requests back to the caller. ([!1604], [!1608], [!1610], [!1616], [!1620], [!1625])


### Client features

- We now have an experimental feature to select exits by country, with
  geoip support. It is Rust-only, and not yet exposed via a
  configuration option. ([!1537])
- When contacting an onion service, we now pad our `INTRODUCE2`
  message payload to a uniform size in order to conceal what kind of
  data and extensions it contains.  ([#1031], [!1602])

### Documentation and examples

- We've merged several example programs from Saksham Mittal's
  project for this year's [Google Summer of Code].  They include a
  downloading tool, a relay checker, and obfs4 checker, a
  tool to lookup DNS over tor, and a program to run a proxy over
  a pluggable transport. You can find them in `examples/gsoc2023`.
  ([!1574])
- Documentation fixes around our description of
  `localhost_port_legacy`.  ([!1588])

### Infrastructure

- Our version-bumping script now allows options to be applied to
  "$CARGO". ([!1573])
- Our CI scripts now use `cargo install --locked` to avoid
  certain compatibility issues in our tools and their dependencies.
  ([!1587])
- The `ArtiPath` types recognized by the key manager are now better
  documented. ([!1586])


### Testing

- New tests for our `tor-ptmgr` string-escaping logic. ([!1579])
- Our runtime mock code now displays more and better information about
  when and where tasks are sleeping. ([!1591], [!1595])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

- Refactoring and API revisions to our experimental backend support
  for launching pluggable transports in server mode. ([!1581])
- Our low-level cryptographic wrappers now have a type to represent
  x25519 (Montgomery) keypairs.  Several internal APIs have adapted
  accordingly. ([!1617])
- The key manager system now supports public keys, for cases where the
  secret key is kept offline. ([!1618])
- The key manager system now supports expanded ed25519 keypairs, so that
  it can represent blinded onion identity keys. ([!1619])
- Cleanups to encryption logic in `tor-proto`. ([!1627])

# Arti 1.1.8 â€” 5 September 2023

Arti 1.1.8 continues work on support for onion services in arti.  It includes
backend support for nearly all of the functionality needed to launch
and publish an onion service and accept incoming requests from onion
service clients.  This functionality is not yet usable, however: we
still need to connect it all together, test and debug it, and provide
high-level APIs to allow the user to actually turn it on.

### Major bugfixes

- Do not allow the user to set `bridges = true` without having
  configured any bridges.  Previously, this configuration was
  possible, and it caused arti to connect without using any
  bridges. This is tracked as [TROVE-2023-002]. ([#1000], [!1481])

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- In `tor-dirclient`, `Requestable::make_request` now returns
  `Request<String>`. ([cd6c4674dc560d9c1dc3])
- In `tor-ptclient`, `PtParameters` been split, and
  `PluggableTransport` has become a trait. ([bbed17ba4a44a4690ad6])
- Additionally, many unstable APIs (marked with the `experimental-api`
  feature and similar) and APIs in unstable crates (like
  `tor-hsservice` and `tor-keymgr`) have changed.

### Onion service development

- We began laying more groundwork for onion services, with a set of
  low-level API designs, algorithm designs, and data
  structures. ([#970], [#971], [#972], [!1452], [!1444], [!1541])
- Fuzzing support and significant speed improvements to the (still
  unused) [HashX]-based proof-of-work code. ([!1446], [!1462],
  [!1459], [!1513], [!1524], [!1529], [!1538], [!1539], [!1555])
- Added low-level support in [`tor-proto`] for accepting incoming data
  streams on a circuit. Onion services will use this to accept `BEGIN`
  messages. ([#864], [#994], [#998], [#1009], [!1451], [!1474], [!1475],
  [!1476], [!1477], [!1484], [!1519])
- Keystore directory configuration is now derived from the configured
  state directory when using `TorClientConfigBuilder::from_directories`.
  ([#988], [!1498])
- Expose the `KH` circuit-binding material, as needed for the
  rendezvous handshake. ([#993], [!1472])
- Backend code to establish an introduction point, keep it
  established, and watch for `INTRODUCE2` messages. ([!1510], [!1511],
  [!1516], [!1517], [!1522], [!1540])
- Backend code to decode an `INTRODUCE2` message, complete the
  necessary cryptographic handshakes, open a circuit to the client's
  chosen rendezvous point, establish a shared virtual hop, and receive
  `BEGIN` messages. ([#980], [#1013], [!1512], [!1520], [!1521],
  [!1536], [!1547])
- Taught the `tor-dirclient` crate how to upload onion service
  descriptors. ([!1505])
- Revise and debug logic for locating items the HsDir ring when
  publishing. ([#960], [!1494], [!1518])
- Refactor onion service error handling. ([!1515])
- Backend code to select introduction points and keep track of which ones
  are running correctly. ([!1523], [!1549], [!1550], [!1559])
- Refactor HsDesc parsing code to remove `inner::IntroPointDesc`. ([!1528])
- Initial backend code to regenerate and publish onion service descriptors
  as needed. ([#977], [!1545])

### Documentation

- Fix documentation about the [`OnionAddressDisabled`] error: it was
  missing a "not".  ([!1467])
- Correct details about upcoming milestones in our [top-level `README.md`].
  ([!1471])

### Infrastructure

- New release script to bump the patchlevel of a crate without
  treating it as a dependency change. ([#945], [!1461])
- New script to make sure that all checked-in `Cargo.lock` files
  are correct. ([!1468])
- Usability improvements to our coverage script. ([!1485])
- In CI, verify that our scripts are using `/usr/bin/env` to find their
  interpreters in the proper locations. ([!1489], [!1490])

### Testing

- Improve test coverage for the `tor-cert` crate. ([!1495], [!1496],
  [!1497])
- Improve test coverage for the `tor-proto` crate. ([!1501])

### Cleanups, minor features, and smaller bugfixes

- Improved error handling when a `[[bridges.transports]]` section does
  not include any required pluggable transport. ([#880], [!1229])
- Key manager APIs are now less tied to the SSH key format, and no
  longer require that x25519 keys be stored as ed25519 keys. ([#936],
  [#965], [!1464], [!1508])
- Downgrade lints for built-in warnings to "warn". Previously two of
  them (`missing_docs`, `unreachable_pub`) were set to "deny", which
  had a risk of breaking compilation in the future. ([#951], [!1470])
- Expose the `HopNum` type from `tor-proto`, to help avoid off-by-one
  errors. ([eee3bb8822dd22a4], [#996], [!1548])
- Deprecate and replace `ClientCirc::start_conversation_last_hop` with a new
  [`start_conversation`] function that can target any hop. ([#959], [!1469])
- New functions in `tor-proto` to wait for a channel or a circuit
  to shut down. ([!1473])
- Improved error messages and behaviors when we can't decide where to
  look for our configuration files. ([!1478], [!1479], [!1480])
- Deprecated and renamed `download` in `tor-dirclent` to
  `send_request`. ([9a08f04a7698ae23])
- Deprecate [`DropNotifyEofSignallable::is_eof`]. ([f4dfc146948d491c])
- New [`ClientCirc::send_raw_msg`] function for cases where we want
  to send a message without starting a conversation. ([#1010], [!1525])
- Experimental backend support for launching pluggable transports in server
  mode, for testing and example code. ([!1504])

# Arti 1.1.7 â€” 1 August 2023

Arti 1.1.7 focuses on maintenance, bugfixing, and cleanups to earlier
releases.  It also lays groundwork for being able to run as an onion
service.

### Major bugfixes

- We now build with onion service client support by default.  It is
  still not enabled by default, but you no longer need any special
  _compile-time_ options in order to be able to use it. ([#948],
  [!1382])
- Fix an over-strict parsing behavior that had prevented Arti
  from connecting to onion services whose descriptors were
  encoded by Stem. ([#952], [!1389])
- We've fixed a bug where we incorrectly marked bridges as having
  directory information where they did not, and tried to build
  circuits through them without fetching descriptors. ([#638],
  [!1408])
- Fix a deadlock in [`TorClient::reconfigure()`]. ([!1432])

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- The [`Conversation`] API has been built as a replacement for the old
  "control message" API on circuits, to better support the needs of
  onion services. ([#917], [!1367], [!1402])
- The `tor-config` crate no longer exposes `ItemOrBool`, which was
  not used. ([5b97b0b2ce31b3db])
- The [`RetryError`] type now requires that its members implement
  `AsRef<dyn Error>`. ([36b9d11ecb122e1e])
- The error type of [`tor_hsclient::ConnError::Failed`] has changed.
  ([36b9d11ecb122e1e])

### Onion service development

- Continued improvements to our key manager infrastructure. ([#903], [#937], [#939], [#954], [!1372], [!1398], [!1399], [!1404], [!1413], [!1421], [!1433])
- Design work and API backend designs for implementing the service
  side of onion services. ([!1422], [!1429])
- Rust implementations of the [HashX] ASIC-resistant hash function and
  the related [EquiX] proof-of-work function, for eventual use
  in protecting onion services from denial-of-service attacks.
  Note that for now, the license on these crates is "LGPL-3.0-only";
  we hope to relicense under "MIT OR Apache-2.0" if the author
  of the C version of this code approves.
  ([#889], [!1368])

### Documentation

- Improved documentation for how Arti is validated and released.
  ([#942], [!1366])
- Improvement to bridge and transport-related documentation.
  ([#706], [!1370])
- Add documentation to explain how to build an `arti` binary that
  will not include build path details. ([#957], [!1435])

### Infrastructure

- Our [Shadow] CI tests now include support for onion service clients.
  ([!1292])
- Our Runtime logic now has much improved support for test cases that
  need to handle time and waiting, and more consistently generated
  mock implementations.  This has enabled us to clean up various unit
  tests. ([!1375], [!1378], [!1381])
- Fix a compatibility issue that had been preventing our Chutney CI
  tests from passing. ([c98894cebc60e223], [!1391], [!1393])

### Logging improvements

- We now ensure that all panics from `arti` are sent to our logs.
  Formerly, they were only reported on stderr.  ([#921], [!1377])
- Our logfile messages now have a configurable granularity, to avoid
  logging excessive detail that could help with traffic analysis
  attacks.  The default is one second granularity, and can be
  overridden with the `logging.time_granularity` option.  Note that
  this granularity does not apply to systems like `journald` that have
  their own ideas about how to record messages. ([#551], [!1376])
- When logging errors, we now check whether the type of the error
  indicates a bug.  If it does, we always escalate the logging
  severity to "warn" or higher.  ([!1379], [!1383], [!1386], [!1390])
- When reporting errors caused by the failure of multiple retry
  attempts, we take more care to report the source failure
  causes. ([#958], [!1416])

### Cleanups, minor features, and smaller bugfixes

- Rename some mocking-related functions to avoid accidental
  infinite-recursion bugs. ([!1365])
- Fix or disable a series of new warnings from Clippy. ([!1369],
  [!1394], [!1395], [!1396])
- Our (not yet used) GeoIP code now encodes country codes
  as two _nonzero_ bytes, which enables the [niche optimization].
  ([!1384])
- Our (not yet used) GeoIP code now treats zero-values ASNs
  as indicating an unknown ASN, for compatibility with the format
  used by the C tor implementation. ([#961], [!1417])
- We now try to avoid using [`Rng::gen_range()`], due to the
  possibility of panics.  We have instead added a
  `gen_range_checked()` and a `gen_range_infallible()` call. ([#920], [!1385],
  [!1387])
- The `ChanMgr` API now exposes a function to build unmanaged channels,
  in order to support external code that wants to build
  channels that are not managed by or shared with the rest of
  Arti. ([!1374], [!1403], [!1406])
- The [`NetDir`] API now has optional support for recording the
  associated country codes of its relays. ([!1364])
- Bridges no longer contain addresses twice. This prevents us from
  making unnecessary connections. ([!1409])
- In [`fs-mistrust`], we now detect several kinds of errors related
  to failed user or group lookup. ([cdafa2ce0191f612])
- We have migrated our Unix user info lookups from the
  no-longer-maintained `users` crate to the new [`pwd-grp`]
  crate. ([#877], [!1410])
- Add accessors for several bridge-related config builder types.
  ([!1425], [!1426])
- Refactor handling of initial `CREATE` cells when opening a circuit,
  to clean up our reactor loop logic a bit. ([!1441])

### Removed features

- We no longer publish the crate `arti-bench` to crates.io.  It has no
  use outside of development.  ([!1371])
- We no longer publish our as-yet-unused `tor-events` and
  `tor-congestion` crates to crates.io.  They aren't used in the rest
  of Arti yet. ([!1371])
- We no longer validate our code with Clippy's `missing_panics_doc`
  lint, since it has begun to warn about all use of `expect()`
  in nightly. ([#950], [!1380])

# Arti 1.1.6 â€” 30 June 2023

Arti 1.1.6 completes the core of the work needed for a client
to connect to onion services on the Tor network.  This is not yet
enabled by default: we do not yet recommend using this feature for
security-sensitive purposes, because of some
[missing security features][#98].
Instructions for enabling it and trying it out can be found in the
[README.md] file.
(Note that version 1.1.6 also requires a non-default cargo feature to
be enabled: you must build with `--features=arti/onion-service-client`.)

Additionally, this version includes an experimental key manager
implementation. Currently it's used to store the keys needed for
client authentication, but in the future it will store the keys for
onion services themselves, and eventually relays.  In this release it
is still missing some import functionality for interoperability;
the interface is likely to change significantly.

Work on our RPC subsystem has also continued; we have achieved several
prerequisites needed for applications' SOCKS connections to
integrate correctly with the RPC subsystem.

And as usual, there are a large number of smaller fixes and improvements
throughout the codebase.

### Major bugfixes

- Downgrade our dependency on x25519-dalek from "2.0.0-rc.2" to
  "2.0.0-pre.1".  The former had a compatibility bug that made it stop
  working once a newer version of `curve25519-dalek` was released.  We
  hope to [re-upgrade] to a more recent version of this crate in a
  future release. ([#926], [!1317])

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- We have removed an empty `relaycell::restrict` module from the
  `tor-cell` crate.  This module was added in error.  This change will
  break any code that (pointlessly) tried to import
  it. ([589fefd581e962a7])

### Onion service development

- Implement the core logic of an onion service client.  Having fetched a
  descriptor for an onion service, we now establish a rendezvous
  circuit, and try to send INTRODUCE1 requests to the service's
  introduction points, while waiting for a RENDEZVOUS2 message in
  response on the rendezvous circuit. Once the message is received, we
  can launch streams to the service over that circuit. ([!1228],
  [!1230], [!1235], [!1238], [!1240])
- Re-launch and retry onion service connection attempts as
  appropriate. ([!1246])
- Onion service descriptors now have accessor functions to enable their
  actual use. ([!1220])
- We can transform the information about relays used in onion service
  descriptors, and in introduce1 cells, into the format needed to connect
  to the relay described. ([!1221])
- Generate random rendezvous cookies to identify circuits at a client's
  rendezvous point. ([!1227])
- Ensure that specific information about onion services, rendezvous
  points, and introduction points are treated as sensitive or redacted
  in our error messages. ([!1326], [!1335])
- Reduce the cost of duplicating HsDir rings in our network
  objects. ([#883], [!1234])
- Refactor and simplify our `hs_ntor` APIs to better reuse state
  information. ([bb6115103aad177c])
- Return a more informative error type from our time-period manipulation
  code. ([!1244])
- Remember our introduction point experiences, and try to use known-good
  ones before ones that have failed recently. ([!1247], [!1295])
- We now adjust the size of our pre-constructed circuit pool dynamically
  based on past demand for onion-service circuits (or lack
  thereof). ([686d5cf2093322e4])
- Speed improvements to the algorithm we use to select pre-constructed
  circuits for onion services, and correctness fixes to those speed
  improvements. ([1691c353924f89cc], [#918], [!1296], [!1301])
- The `StreamPrefs::connect_to_onion_services` method now can be used to
  enable or disable onion service connections, and TorClients can handle
  onion services correctly. ([!1257])
- Provide the extended SOCKS5 error codes as documented in
  [proposal 304]. ([#736], [!1248], [!1279])
- Drop introduction circuits after they are no longer needed. ([!1299],
  [!1303])
- Expire long-unused onion service circuits. ([!1287], [!1302])
- Expire long-unused onion service descriptors. ([!1290])
- Provide a higher-level HsDescError to explain what, exactly, has gone
  wrong with parsing or decrypting an onion service
  descriptor. ([!1289])
- Respect the maximum onion service descriptor size in the consensus and
  change the default maximum from 50 KiB to 50 KB per the specification.
  ([!1323])
- Go through all of our remaining "TODO HS" comments and make sure that
  they are not issues that should block a release. ([#892], [#928], etc)
- We support enabling or disabling onion service connections via a new
  `allow_onion_addrs` option, and configuring these connections through
  other parameters. ([!1305])
- Ensure that our directory ring parameters are taken from the consensus
  parameters, rather than set unconditionally to defaults. ([!1310])
- Enforce upper bounds on the number of introduction points in an
  onion service descriptor. ([!1332])
- Use correct circuit parameters when creating onion service circuits.
  ([#935], [!1340])
- Use more accurate timeout predictions for building and using onion
  service circuits. ([!1342])


### RPC development

- Our RPC engine now supports holds a list of SOCKS connections,
  so that applications can register their SOCKS connections with their
  RPC sessions. ([545984b095119ecc])
- `TorClient`s, and similar RPC-visible, can now be exposed with a
  secure global identifier so applications can refer to them outside of
  an RPC session. This will allow applications to name a `TorClient` from
  e.g. within the parameters of a SOCKS connection. ([#863], [!1208])
- Enable `rpc::Object`s to be downcast to (some of) the `&dyn Trait`s
  that they implement. This is in tension with some of Rust's current
  limitations, but we need it so that we can downcast a `TorClient` from
  an `Object` into a type we can use in the SOCKS code for opening a
  data stream. ([!1225], [!1253])
- Major refactoring to our RPC session initialization code. ([!1254])

### New crates

- New `tor-keymgr` crate to handle persistent cryptographic keys that
  can be stored to disk. In the future this will be used for all client,
  service, and relay keys. ([!1223], [!1255], [!1256], [!1263], [!1267],
  [!1269], [!1278], [!1280], [!1284], [!1319], [!1321], [!1315],
  [!1321], [!1328], [!1337], etc.)
- New `tor-geoip` crate to handle a static in-binary or on-disk
  IP-to-country lookup table. We will use this in the future to support
  country restrictions on selected paths through the network. ([!1239],
  [!1268])

### Documentation

- Clarify behavior of `ClientCirc::send_control_message`. ([#885],
  [!1219], [58babcb756f6427c])
- Clarify required behavior for `NetDocProvider`. ([!1224])
- More information about how to configure snowflake and other pluggable
  transports. ([#875], [#879], [!1216], [!1249])
- New examples and documentation for how to implement error
  reporting. ([!1213])
- Clarify some error cases for onion service descriptor
  validation. ([!1250], [!1252])
- Improve documentation on the channel and circuit lifecycle. ([!1316],
  [!1318])
- Clarify descriptions in `NetDir`'s documentation of what we mean by
  a "usable" Relay. ([a902f320b5b31812])

### Infrastructure

- For now we ignore an "unmaintained crate" warning for the [`users`] crate
  while we work on [finding a replacement][#877]. ([!1217])
- Our CI now tests each crate individually with its default
  features. This helps detect bugs where a crate was only working
  because it had been built with the features required of it by another
  crate. ([!1250])
- We now supplement our existing system for tracking semver-breaking
  issues with the [`cargo-semver-checks`] tool. We require version
  0.22.1 or later. ([!1339])

### Cleanups, minor features, and smaller bugfixes

- We no longer use the [`arrayref`] crate to convert slice-references
  into array references.  In recent versions of Rust, we can simply use
  TryFrom and const generics. ([#872], [!1214])
- Our consensus directory objects now expose accessors that list
  required and recommended protocol versions.  ([205b6d176c4a619b])
- The `tor-error` crate now exposes a convenience macro to derive
  `AsRef<dyn Error>` for our specific error types. ([33c90e5b7243c3b3])
- The formerly experimental `send_control_message` API now takes an
  `AnyRelayMsg` rather than a cell, as does its associated `MsgHandler`
  API. ([#881], [#887], [!1232], [!1236])
- Backend code to more readily display and redact relay
  identities. ([#882], [!1233])
- `tor-proto` no longer gives an error when trying to use `SENDME`
  messages with a relay digest algorithm with an output length of other
  than 20.  ([!1242])
- `tor-llcrypto` now exposes a method to try to look up an element from
  a slice in constant time. ([25db56777c0042a9])
- Apply two now-universally-available clippy lints to all of our crates.
  ([!1271])
- Add experimental API to expose a `chanmgr` method from
  `TorClient`. ([!1275])
- The `ClientCirc::path_ref()` method now returns an `Arc<Path>` type,
  which can be used to find information about a circuit's path without
  extensive copying.  The old `path()` method still exists, but is
  deprecated. ([#787], [!1286])
- `CircMgr` now exposes its estimates for good timeouts for circuit
  operations. ([!1281].)
- Fix a compilation warning on Windows. ([!1294])
- Make sure DirProviderBuilder is `Send + Sync`, so that
  TorClientBuilder is always `Send + Sync`. ([#924], [!1307])
- Implement conversion from ed25519 private keys to curve25519 private
  keys, as part of our eventual compatibility with ssh's key storage
  format. ([!1297])
- Numerous improvements and fixes to our configuration handling tests.
  ([!1320], [!1330])
- Refactor some duplicate logic in our circuit-retention code. ([!1322])
- Experimentally expose some of `NetDir`'s information about whether
  a relay is in the consensus (independent of whether we have full
  information about it). ([!1325])


### Removed features

- We no longer support ancient (pre-0.3.6) versions of Tor without
  support for authenticated SENDME messages. ([#914], [!1283])

# Arti 1.1.5 â€” 1 June 2023

Arti 1.1.5 fixes a local-only denial-of-service attack, and continues
our work towards support for providing a working RPC mechanism and an
onion service client.

### Major bugfixes (service)

- Fix a local-only CPU denial-of-service bug. Previously, an attacker
  with access to our SOCKS port (only open by default on localhost)
  could cause Arti to loop forever, consuming CPU. This issue was
  discovered by Jakob Lell. This is also tracked as
  TROVE-2023-001. ([#861], [!1196])

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- In [`tor-netdoc`], the `ParseErrorKind` and `ParseErrorSource` types
  have been renamed to `NetdocErrorKind` and `NetdocErrorSource`
  respectively, to better reflect their meaning. ([!1176], [!1179])
- In [`tor-linkspec`] and [`tor-cell`], we have renamed
  `UnparsedLinkSpec` to `EncodedLinkSpec` to correctly reflect its
  purpose. ([02785ca6505572bd])
- In [`tor-cell`], the `Extend2` message now takes a list of `EncodedLinkSpec`.
  ([7ce808b75bb500f2])
- In [`tor-linkspec`], `CircTarget::linkspecs()` now returns an encoded
  list instead of a `Vec` of unencoded link specifiers. This is needed
  for passing linkspecs verbatim in the onion service
  implementation. ([7ce808b75bb500f2])
- `ClientCirc` no longer implements `Clone`.  In various crates,
  functions that used to return `ClientCirc` now return
  `Arc<ClientCirc>`.  This allows us to be more explicit about how
  circuits are shared, and to make circuits visible to our RPC
  code. ([#846], [!1187])

### Onion service development

- Improved API for parsing onion service descriptors. ([#809], [!1152])
- More APIs for deriving onion service keys from one another.
  ([18cb1671c4135b3d])
- Parse onion service descriptors after receiving them. ([!1153])
- When fetching an onion service descriptor, choose the HS
  directory server at random. ([!1155])
- Refactoring and improvements to our handling for sets of link
  specifiers (components of a Tor relay's address) in order to support
  lists of link specifiers that we receive as part of an INTRODUCE2
  message or onion service descriptor. ([#794], [!1177])
- Code to enforce rules about consistency of link specifier lists.
  ([#855], [!1186])
- Correctly handle onion service descriptor lifetimes, and introduce
  necessary helper functions to handle overlapping sets of lifetime
  bounds. ([!1154])
- Additional design and specification about a key management system.
  ([!1185])
- Finish, refactor, debug, and test the hs-ntor handshake used to
  negotiate keys with onion services. ([#865], [!1189])
- Export the unencrypted portion of an INTRODUCE1 message as needed
  to implement the hs-ntor handshake. ([#866], [!1188])
- Add support for adding the "virtual" hop for an onion service
  rendezvous circuit based on a set of cryptographic material negotiated via
  the `hs-ntor` handshake. ([#726], [!1191])

### RPC development

- Improved description of our work-in-progress RPC API design.
  ([!1005])
- Expose an initial TorClient object to our RPC sessions.
  ([d7ab388faf96f53e])
- Implement object-handle management backend for RPC sessions,
  so that RPC commands can refer to objects by a capability-style
  ID that doesn't make objects visible to other sessions.
  This has required significant design refinement, and will likely
  need more in the future.
  ([#820], [#848], [!1160], [!1183], [!1200])
- Add an experimental `StreamCtrl` mechanism to allow code (like the RPC
  module) that does not own the read or write side of a data stream to
  nonetheless monitor and control the stream. ([#847], [!1198])

### Infrastructure

- Our license checking code now allows the MPL-2.0 license on an
  allow-list basis. ([#845], [e5fa42e1c7957db0])
- Our [`fixup-features`] script now works correctly to enforce our rules
  about the `full` feature (notably, that it must include all
  features not labelled as experimental or non-additive).
  ([!1180], [!1182])
- The script that generates our Acknowledgments section now
  looks at various Git trailers in order to better acknowledge bug reporters.
  ([!1194])
- Use the latest version of Shadow in our integration tests. ([!1199])

### Cleanups, minor features, and smaller bugfixes

- Improved logging in directory manager code when deciding what to
  download and when to download it. ([#803], [!1163])
- Downgrade and clarify log messages about directory replacement time.
  ([#839])
- Revise and downgrade other directory-manager logs. ([#854], [!1172])
- When listing the features that are enabled, list static features
  correctly. ([!1169])
- Refactor the `check_key` function in `tor-cert` to provide a more
  reasonable API. ([#759], [!1184])
- Improve or downgrade certain verbose log messages in `tor-guardmgr`
  and `tor-proto`. ([!1190])
- Throughout our codebase, avoid the use of ed25519 secret keys without
  an accompanying public key. Instead, store the two as a
  keypair. (Using ed25519 secret keys alone creates the risk of using
  them with mismatched public keys, with
  [catastrophic cryptographic results].)  ([#798], [!1192])

### Network updates

- Update to the latest list of Tor fallback directories. ([!1210])

# Arti 1.1.4 â€” 3 May 2023

Arti 1.1.4 fixes a major bug in the directory downloading code that
could cause clients to stay stuck with an old version of the
directory.

Additionally, this version advances our efforts on onion services:
we have implementations for descriptor downloading, and a design for
improved key management.

For this month and the next, our efforts are divided between onion
services and work on a new RPC API (a successor to C Tor's "control
port") that will give applications a safe and powerful way to work
with Arti without having to write their code in Rust or link Arti as
a library (unless they want to).  We have an early version of this
protocol implemented, but it does not yet expose any useful
functionality.

Arti 1.1.4 also increases our MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version)
to Rust 1.65, in accordance with our [MSRV Policy], and renames a
few other inconsistently-named APIs.


### Major Bugfixes

- Download directories correctly in the case where we start with our cache
  containing all the microdescriptors from the previous directory.
  Previously, we had a bug where we only checked whether it was time
  to fetch a new consensus when we added a new microdescriptor from
  the network.  This bug could lead to Arti running for a while
  with an expired directory. ([#802], [!1126])

### Breaking changes

- We now require Rust 1.65 or later for all of our crates.
  This change is required so that we can work correctly with several
  of our dependencies, including the [`typetag`] crate which we
  will need for RPC. ([#815], [!1131], [!1137])
- In all crates, rename `*ProtocolFailed` errors to `*ProtocolViolation`.
  This is a more correct name, but does potentially break API users
  depending on the old versions. ([#804], [!1121], [!1132])


### Breaking changes in lower level crates

- Convert the DirClient request type for `RouterDesc`s into an enum,
  and remove its `push()` method.
  ([!1112])
- Rename `BridgeDescManager` to `BridgeDescMgr` for consistency
  with other type names. ([#805] (!1122))
- In `tor-async-utils`, rename `SinkExt` to `SinkPrepareExt`, since it is not
  actually an extension trait on all `Sink`s. ([5cd5e6a3f8431eab])

### Onion service development

- Added and refactored some APIs in `tor-netdir` to better support onion
  service HSDir rings. ([!1094])
- Clean up APIs for creating encrypted onion service descriptors. ([!1097])
- Support for downloading onion service descriptors on demand.  ([!1116], [!1118])
- Design an API and document on-disk behavior for a
  [key-management subsystem], to be used not
  only for onion services, but eventually for other kinds of keys. ([#834], [!1147])

### RPC/Embedding development

- New specification for our capabilities-based RPC meta-protocol in
  [`rpc-meta-draft`]. ([!1078], [!1107], [!1141])
- An incomplete work-in-progress implementation of our new RPC framework,
  with a capabilities-based JSON-encoded protocol that allows for
  RPC-visible methods to be implemented on objects throughout our
  codebase.  For now, it is off-by-default, and exposes nothing useful.
  ([!1092], [!1136], [!1144], [!1148])

### Documentation

- Better explain how to build our documentation. ([!1090])
- Explain that we explicitly support `--document-private-items`. ([!1090])

# tor-llcrypto patch release 0.4.4 â€” 4 April 2023

On 4 April 2023, we put out a patch release (0.4.4) to `tor-llcrypto`,
to fix a compatibility issue.  We had previously configured the
`tor-llcrypto` crate to work with any version of [`x25519-dalek`]
version "2.0.0-pre.1" or later, but the recent release of version
"2.0.0-rc.2" had a breaking change that stopped `tor-llcrypto` from
compiling.  The new version of `tor-llcrypto` now properly pins the
old version of `x25519-dalek`, to avoid picking up such incompatible
pre-releases.  We hope that our next release of tor-llcrypto will
upgrade to the newer `x25519-dalek` release.
Additional resources: [#807] [!1108].

# Arti 1.1.3 â€” 31 March 2023

Arti 1.1.3 continues our work on onion services.  We can now parse all
of the relevant message types, build circuits as needed to target
relays, build and sign onion service descriptors, and deliver onion service
requests to our `hsclient` code.

We've also solved a few annoying bugs, made our CI more bulletproof against
certain programming mistakes, and exposed a few APIs that had been missing
before elsewhere in our code.

### Major bugfixes

- Prevent a fatal error when finding a usable consensus in a read-only
  directory store. ([#779], [!1055])

### Breaking changes in lower level crates

- Moved futures-related utilities from `tor-basic-utils` to a new
  `tor-async-utils` crate. ([!1091])
- When the `expand-paths` Cargo feature is not enabled, we now reject
  paths in our configuration containing unescaped `$` and `~` strings.
  Previously we would treat them as literals, which would break
  when `expand-paths` was provided. ([#790], [!1069])

### Onion service development

- We now have working implementations for all of the message types that Tor
  uses to implement onion services. These are included in our fuzzing, and
  are cross-validated against the C Tor implementation. ([!1038], [!1043],
  [!1045], [!1052])
- Our onion service descriptor parsing code now validates the inner
  certificates embedded in the descriptors, for parity with C Tor's behavior.
  ([#744], [!1044])
- Refactor responsibility for HS circuit management out of `CircMgr`.
  ([!1047])
- Revise APIs and outline implementations for the initial parts of a state
  manager and client implementation.  ([!1034], [!1086])
- Handle requests for `.onion` addresses by routing them to our onion service
  code.  (This code does not yet do anything useful.) ([!1060], [!1071],
  [!1098])
- Our circuit implementation now has APIs needed to send special-purpose
  messages and receive replies for them.  We'll use this to implement
  onion service handshakes outside of the `tor-proto` module. ([!1051])
- Implement functionality to pre-construct and launch circuits as needed for
  onion service directory, introduction, and rendezvous
  communications. ([#691], [!1065])
- Implement code to construct, encrypt, and sign onion service
  descriptors. ([#745], [!1070], [!1084])
- More work on usable APIs for HSDir ring. ([!1095])

### Infrastructure

- Add a new `check_env` script to detect whether the environment is set
  up correctly to build Arti. ([!1030])
- We have the beginnings of a `fixup-features` tool, to make sure that our
  "full" and "experimental" Cargo features behave in the way we expect,
  and eventually to enable us to use [`cargo-semver-checks`] on our
  non-experimental features only.  This tool is not yet ready for
  use; its semantics are subtly wrong. ([#771], [!1059])
- Our CI scripts now rejects merges containing the string
  "XX<!-- look, a squirrel -->XX";
  we use this string to indicate places where the code must be fixed
  before it can be merged. ([#782], [!1067])

### Testing

- More of our tests now specify times using [`humantime`] (rather than as
  a number of seconds since the Unix epoch). ([!1037])
- Our fuzzers now compile again.
  ([53e44b58f5fa0cfa], [!1063])

### Documentation

- New example code for building a `BridgeConfig` and launching a TorClient
  with bridges, without having a config file. ([#791], [!1074])


### Cleanups, minor features, and minor bugfixes

- Our `caret` macro now works correctly for uninhabited
  enumerations. ([841905948f913f73])
- Defend against possible misuse of [`tor_bytes::Reader::extract_n`].
  This wasn't a security hole, but could have become one in the
  future. ([!1053])
- Do not ask exits to resolve IP addresses: we already know the IP address
  for an IP address. ([!1057])
- Fix a bunch of new warnings from Rust 1.68. ([!1062])
- Expose builder for [`TransportConfigList`] as part of the public
  API. ([455a7a710917965f])
- Enforce use of blinded keys in places where they are required. ([!1081])
- Add accessors for the [`Blockage`] type, so other programs can
  ask what has gone wrong with the connection to the network. ([#800], [!1088])

# Arti 1.1.2 â€” 28 February 2023

Arti 1.1.2 continues our work on onion services, and builds out more of
the necessary infrastructure, focusing on backend support for the onion
service directories.

We've also done a significant revision on our handling of incoming
messages on circuits, to avoid a fair amount of unnecessary copying, and
defer message parsing until we're certain that the message type would be
acceptable in a given context.  Doing this turned up several bugs, which
are now fixed too.

### Breaking changes in lower level crates

- The APIs for `tor-cell` have changed significantly, to help
  implement [#525] and prepare for [#690]. This has no downstream
  implications outside of `tor-proto`.
- Our [`IntegerMinutes`] type no longer has an erroneous `days()` accessor.
  (This accessor did not work correctly, and actually returned a
  number of minutes!) ([bb2ab7c2a3e0994bb43])
- The [`PartialNetDir::fill_from_previous_netdir()`] function has
  changed its argument types and semantics. ([f69d7f96ac40dda5])

(Breaking changes in experimental APIs are not noted here.)

### New features

- We now have the facility to give a helpful "error hint" in response to
  a given failure. Right now, we use this to improve the error message
  given for file-system permission errors, so that it suggests either
  changing the permissions on a directory, or suppressing the error.
  ([#578], [#579], [!976], [!994], [!1018])
- When we log an error message from inside our code (at "info" or higher), we
  now make sure to log a full _error report_, including the cause of the
  error, its cause, and so on. ([#680], [!997])
- When receiving messages on channels, circuits, and streams, we now
  defer parsing those messages until we know whether their types
  are acceptable. This shrinks our attack surface, simplifies our code,
  and makes our protocol handling less error-prone. ([#525], [!1008],
  [!1013], [!1017])
- We now copy relay cell bodies much less than previously. ([#7],
  [ca3b33a1afc58b84])
- We have support for handling link specifier types verbatim, for cases
  when we need to use them to contact a rendezvous point or introduction
  point without checking them. ([!1029])

### Onion service development

- We can now parse onion service descriptors, including all encrypted layers,
  with support for descriptor-based client authentication. ([#744], [!999],
  [!1015])
- Our network directory code now supports deriving the `HsDir` directory
  ring, to find out where onion service descriptors should be uploaded and
  downloaded. ([#687], [!1012])
- We've refactored our implementation of onion service message
  extensions into a single place, to save on code and avoid type
  confusion.  ([5521df0909ff7afa])
- Our _internal_ onion-service Cargo features have been renamed to
  start with `hs-*`. We're still using `onion-*` as the prefix for our
  high-level onion-service features. ([#756], [!1033])

### Infrastructure

- All our shell scripts now work when `bash` is somewhere other than `/bin`.
  ([!990])
- Our `check_doc_features` script is now a little more reliable.
  ([!1023])
- Our coverage tools now perform better checks to make sure they
  have all of their dependencies. ([#776], [!1025])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

- The internal data structures in [`tor-netdir`] now use the
  [`typed_index_collections`] crate to ensure that the indices for one
  list are not mis-used as indices into another. ([!1004])
- We no longer reject authority certificates that contain an unrecognized
  keyword. ([#752], [266c61f7213dbec7])
- Our [`tor-netdoc`] parsing code now requires the caller to specify
  handling for unrecognized keywords explicitly, to avoid future instances
  of bug [#752]. ([!1006])
- Several internal APIs and patterns in [`tor-netdoc`] have been streamlined.
  ([#760], [!1016], [!1021])
- Make extension-handling code in for onion service message decoding more
  generic, since we'll reuse it a lot. ([!1020])
- We now kill off circuits under more circumstances when the other side of
  the circuit violates the protocol. ([#769], [#773], [!1026])
- We now expire router descriptors as soon as _any_ of their internal
  expiration times has elapsed. Previously, we expired them when _all_
  of their expiration times had elapsed, which is incorrect. ([#772],
  [!1022])
- We are much more careful than previous about validating the correctness
  of various message types on half-closed streams. Previously, we
  had separate implementations for message validation; now, we use
  a single object to check messages in both cases. ([#744], [!1026])
- We now treat a `RESOLVED` message as closing a half-closed resolve stream.
  Previously, we left the stream open. ([!1026])

# Arti 1.1.1 â€” 1 February 2023

After months of work, we have a new release of Arti!
Arti 1.1.1  is an incremental release, and cleans up a few issues from
previous releases, including a few annoyances and limitations.

More significantly, Arti 1.1.1 begins our work on [Onion Services].
This code won't be finished till later this year, but you can read about
our process below.

### Breaking changes in lower level crates

- Some accessors for the message types in [`tor-cell`] are renamed. ([#608],
  [!948])

### New features

- When logging an error at severity `info` or higher, we now (sometimes)
  include a full report of the error's sources. Previously we only
  logged the highest-level error, which often lacked enough detail to
  make a full diagnosis. This work will be completed in a subsequent
  release.([!936])
- When asked via SOCKS to resolve an address that is already an IP
  address, we now just return the same address, rather than asking the
  Tor network.  ([#714], [!957])
- There is a new release profile, `quicktest`, for development purposes.
  It should run faster than `debug`, but compile faster than `release`.
  It is meant for quick integration and acceptance test purposes.
  ([#639], [!960])
- The `TorClient` object now exposes a [`set_stream_prefs`] API to let
  callers change their stream settings without cloning a new
  `TorClient`.  ([#718], [!977])

### Onion service development

- There is now an unimplemented draft set of high-level and low-level
  APIs throughout our codebase that we will need to implement onion
  services.  These not-yet-functional APIs are gated behind the
  `onion-client` and `onion-service` features.  They are not covered by
  semantic versioning; we will use them to guide our implementation
  efforts in the coming months. ([#525], [#716], [!959], [!966], [!969],
  [!970], [!971], [!972], [!974])
- We have implemented the private-key version of the key-blinding algorithm
  used in onion services. ([#719], [!964])
- We now parse and expose consensus network parameters related to onion
  services. ([!968])
- Our SOCKS backend now supports returning the extended onion service
  SOCKS result codes from [proposal 304]. ([#736], [!978])
- The `tor-netdoc` crate now has a (not-yet-used) backend for
  constructing documents in Tor's metaformat. ([!969], [!984])
- Implement the lower level cryptographic key types
  (and some of the cryptographic algorithms) used by onion
  services. ([#684], [#742], [!980])
- Add support for parsing [Shared Random Values] from consensus
  documents, including the extensions from [proposal 342].
- In `tor-netdir`, implement the algorithms for determining the current
  time period and constructing the cryptographic parameters for each
  period's HsDir ring. ([#686], [!987])


### Network updates

- Update to the latest identity key for the directory authority `moria1`.
  ([!922])
- Retire the directory authority `faravahar`. ([!924], [tor#40688])

### Testing

- Upgrade to a newer version of the [Shadow] simulator, and use it to
  test Arti with bridges. ([#651], [!915])
- More tests for our safe-logging features. ([!928])
- More tests for error cases in persistent-data manager. ([!930])
- We now have a standard block of `clippy` exceptions that we allow in our
  test code, and we apply it uniformly. ([!937])
- In our Shadow scripts, use bare paths to find `tor` and `tgen`. ([!949])

### Documentation

- Move internal-facing documentation into a `doc/dev` subdirectory, so that
  it's easy for downstream users to ignore it. ([#576], [!921])
- Make the summary line style consistent across our `README` files,
  and make the crate list in [`Architecture.md`] match. ([!951])
- Add more high level documentation to [`Architecture.md`], including a
  rough crate-dependency diagram, and an object model diagram for our
  manager types. ([#624], [!963])

### Example code

- Make the `arti-hyper` example code compile and work correctly on
  OSX. ([#569], [#715], [!958])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

- Use Rust 1.60's [conditional dependency] feature to simplify our
  dependency and feature logic. ([#434], [!920])
- Upgrade to [`shellexpand`] 3.x. ([!927])
- The `unwrap` method on [`Sensitive`] is renamed to `into_inner`; `unwrap`
  is now deprecated.  ([!926])
- Clean up tests to use [`humantime`] more, and to specify fewer times as raw
  integers. ([#663], [!931], [!941], [!942], [!943])
- We now use a low-level [`CtByteArray`] type to handle the common case
  of declaring a fixed-length array that should always be compared in
  constant time. ([!962])
- There is now much more diagnostic logging in the pluggable transport
  IPC code, and for connection launching.
  ([#677], [!923])
- We have labeled more data throughout our logs and error messages as
  "sensitive" for logging purposes. ([#556], [!934], [!986])
- We've migrated all of our base64 parsing to [`base64ct`]. (This
  work began with [!600] in Arti 0.5.0; now we have migrated even the
  parsing that doesn't _need_ to be constant-time, under the theory
  that having only one implementation is probably better.)
  ([889206cde4ef29d])
- Our scripts now all indirect through `/usr/bin/env`, to support
  platforms that don't put `bash` in `/bin`. ([!988])
- Clean up various warnings introduced in Rust 1.67. ([#748], [#749], [!992])
- Numerous spelling fixes.

# Arti 1.1.0 â€” 30 November 2022

Arti 1.1.0 adds support for Tor's anti-censorship features: Bridges
(unlisted relays), and Pluggable Transports (external tools to hide what
protocol you're using).

Use of these features can make Arti more effective at gaining access
to Tor, in spite of censorship (or breakage) between you and the wider
public internet.

These features are still very new, so there are likely to be bugs, and
the user experience may not yet be optimal. (In particular, there are a
bunch of spurious warnings and error messages in the logs.) Nonetheless,
we believe that the quality of these features is good enough to be used.

### Breaking changes

- Arti now requires Rust 1.60 or later. This allows us to use a few new
  features, and to upgrade a few of our dependencies that had grown
  stale. See ["Minimum Supported Rust Version" in `README.md`] for more
  information on our MSRV policy. ([#591], [#526], [#613], [#621], [!837])

### Breaking changes in lower level crates

- `SocksHandshake` has been renamed to `SocksProxyHandshake`, to
  distinguish it from `SocksClientHandshake`. ([b08073c2d43d7be5])
- Numerous changes to the bridge-related APIs introduced in 1.0.1.
  ([!758], [#600], [!759], [!780])
- API changes to `tor-dirclient::Response`. ([!782])
- Netinfo cell constructors have been renamed. ([!793])
- The guard manager API no long accepts `NetDir` arguments to most of
  its methods; instead, it expects to be given a `NetDirProvider`.
  ([95a95076a77f4447])
- Move the responsibility for creating a GuardMgr to the `arti-client`
  crate. ([!850])
- Numerous other changes to lower-level APIs.

### New features

- Arti can now connect to bridges when compiled with the `bridge-client`
  feature.  (This is on by default in the `arti` binary.)
  As part of this feature, we have had to implement:

  - Configuration logic for bridges ([#599], [!744], [!745], [!767],
    [!781], [!780], [!783], [!826], [!874], [!877], [!881])
  - Data structures to keep track of relays based on possibly
    non-overlapping sets of keys ([!747], [!774], [!797], [!806])
  - Improved functionality for parsing router descriptors and integrating
    them with our list of bridges ([!755])
  - Large-scale refactoring of the channel-manager internals to handle
    bridges and relays while treating them as distinct. ([!773])
  - Code to download, store, and cache bridge descriptors. ([!782], [!795],
    [!810], [!820], [!827], [!828], [!831], [!834], [!845], [!851],)
  - Allow the guard manager to treat bridges as a kind of guard, and to
    treat bridge-lists and network directories as two kinds of a "universe"
    of possible guards.
    ([!785], [!808], [!815], [!832], [!840])
  - Support code to integrate directory management code with guard management
    code. ([!847], [!852])
  - More careful logging about changes in guard status. ([!869])
  - Logic to retire circuits when the bridge configuration changes.
    ([#650], [!880])

- Arti can now connect via pluggable transports when compiled with the `pt-client`
  feature.  (This is on by default in the `arti` binary.) This has
  required us to implement:

  - Configuration logic for pluggable transports ([!823])
  - The client side of the SOCKS protocol ([!746])
  - An abstraction mechanism to allow the `ChanMgr` code to delegate
    channel construction to caller-provided code. ([!769], [!771], [!887],
    [!888])
  - Integrating the SOCKS client code into the `ChanMgr` code. ([!776])
  - Launching pluggable transports and communicating with them using
    Tor's pluggable transport IPC protocol. ([#394], [!779], [!813])
  - Code to keep track of which pluggable transports are needed,
    and launch them on demand. ([!886], [!893])
  - Support code to integrate the pluggable transport manager with
    `arti-client`. ([#659])
  - A "reactor" task to monitor PT status and launch pluggable transports
    as needed. ([!901], [!903])

- Paths in the configuration can now be configured using
  `${PROGRAM_DIR}`, which means "the directory containing the current
  executable".  ([#586], [!760])
- Some objects can now be marked as "Redactable". A "Redactable" object
  is one that can be displayed in the logs with some of its contents
  suppressed. For example, whereas a full IP might be "192.0.2.7",
  and a completely removed IP would be logged as "`[scrubbed]`",
  a redacted IP might be displayed as "192.x.x.x". ([#648], [!882])

### Testing

- We now use the [Shadow] discrete event simulator to test Arti against a
  simulated Tor network in our CI tests. ([#174], [!634])
- Fuzzing for SOCKS client implementations. ([dc55272602cbc9ff])
- Fuzzing for more types of cells. ([c41305d1100d9685])
- Fuzzing for pluggable transport IPC. ([!814])
- CI testing for more combinations of features. ([#303], [!775])
- CI testing for more targets. ([#585], [!844])
- Better reproducible builds, even on environments with small /dev/shm
  configured. ([#614], [!818])


### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

- We now use the [`hostname-validator`] crate to check hostnames for
  correctness. ([!739])
- Now that we require a more recent Rust, we no longer need to duplicate
  all of our README.md files explicitly in our crate-level
  documentation. ([#603], [!768])
- A few small refactorings to avoid copying. ([!790], [!791])
- Refactor guard-manager code to make it harder to become confused about
  which sample a guard came from. ([19fdf196d89e670f])
- More robust conversion to `u16` at some places in `tor-cell`, to avoid
  future integer overflows. ([!803])
- Refactor our "flag event" to make it easier to (eventually) use in other
  crates. ([!804])
- Significant refactoring of our file-change watching code. ([#562], [!819])
- Upgrade to [`clap` v3] for our command-line option parsing. ([#616], [!830])
- Fix documentation for starting Tor Browser with Arti on Windows. ([!849])
- Allow empty lines at the end of a router descriptor. ([!857])
- Improve some error messages while parsing directory documents.
  ([#640], [!859])
- Internal refactoring in `ChanMgr` to better match current design. ([#606],
  [!864])
- Improve display output for describing relays as channel targets, to provide
  a more useful summary, and avoid displaying too much information about
  guards. ([#647], [!868])
- Better error reporting for some kinds of router descriptor parsing failures.
  ([!870])
- Numerous typo and comment fixes.

# Arti 1.0.1 â€” 3 October  2022

Arti 1.0.1 fixes a few bugs in our previous releases.

This is a fairly small release: Members of our team have spent a lot of
September at a company meeting, on our vacations, and/or recovering from
COVID-19. The feature work we have managed to get done is
largely behind-the-scenes preparation for our anti-censorship release,
which we now hope is coming in early November.

### Breaking changes

- The `Schedule::sleep()*` functions in `tor-rtcompat` now return a
  `Result`.  This change was part of the fix for part of [#572].

### New features

- Optionally expose an accessor to get the [`CircuitBuilder`] from a
  [`CircMgr`]. If you don't mind voiding your semver guarantees,
  you can enable this accessor with the `experimental-api` feature,
  and use it to build circuits using paths of your own creation.
  ([!738])
- We now apply our "safe logging" feature to the console as well, to
  avoid exposing sensitive information in our console log. ([#553],
  [!742])

### Major bugfixes

- Fixed a busy loop that could occur when dropping an Arti client, that
  would cause Arti to busy-loop and use too much CPU. ([#572], [!725])
- Fixed compilation when building with [`async-std`]. ([!723])

### Documentation

- Our high-level documentation has significantly tidied and revised for
  clarity and completeness. ([!717])
- We've updated our documentation for
  [how to use Arti with Tor Browser]. ([!719])

### Infrastructure

- Our reproducible builds now use Rust 1.63, and the code to make
  them has been cleaned up a bit. ([!716])

### Cleanups, minor features, and minor bugfixes

- Fix a test failure that would occur on some platforms depending
  on their inlining decisions. ([#570], [!727])
- Better listing of platforms that don't have [`getresuid()`], so
  that we can compile there without breaking. ([!728])
- Preliminary back-end support for encoding and decoding
  some messages in the onion service protocol. ([!714], [!735], [!736])
- Fixes for various newly implemented [Clippy] warnings. ([!729], [!749])
- The [`RouterDesc`] type now implements `Clone` and
  `Debug`. ([571e7f9556adf12d])
- Preliminary internal API designs for most of the logic needed
  to implement Tor's anti-censorship features.  These APIs are unstable,
  and mostly not implemented yet, but they give us something to fill in.
  ([#543], [#558], [!740], [!743], [!748])

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release, including
Alexander FÃ¦rÃ¸y, Trinity Pointard, and Yuan Lyu.

Also, our deep thanks to [Zcash Community Grants] for funding the development
of Arti 1.0.0!

# Arti 1.0.0 â€” 1 September 2022

Arti 1.0.0 adds a final set of security features, clears up some
portability bugs, and addresses numerous other issues.

With this release, we are now ready to declare Arti *stable*: we are
relatively confident that Arti has the security features that it
needs for usage via the `arti` command-line proxy, or embedding via
the `arti-client` API.

In our next releases, we will focus on adding anti-censorship
features similar to C tor, including support for connecting via
bridges and pluggable transports.


### Breaking changes

- Most of the APIs in the [`arti`] crateâ€”the one providing our
  binaryâ€”are now hidden behind an `experimental-api` feature, to mark
  that they are unstable and unsupported.  If you need to embed `arti`
  in your application, please use the [`arti-client`] crate instead.
  ([#530], [!664])
- The `default_config_file` function has been replaced with
  `default_config_files`, since we now have both a default directory and a
  default file. ([!682])

### Breaking changes in lower-level crates

- New `params()` method in the [`NetDirProvider`] trait, to expose the
  latest parameters even when we don't have a complete directory.
  ([#528], [!658])
- Large refactoring on the traits that represent a relay's set
  of identities, to better support more identity types in the future,
  and to make sure we can support bridges with unknown Ed25519
  identities when we implement them. ([#428], [!662])
- Require that our `TcpStream` types implement `Send`. ([!675])

### New features

- Arti now implements Tor's channel padding feature, to make
  [netflow logs] less useful for traffic analysis. ([#62], [!657])
- Use [`zeroize`] more consistently across our code base. This tool
  clears various sensitive objects before they get dropped, for
  defense-in-depth against memory exposure. ([#254], [!655])
- Provide a "process hardening" feature (on by default) that uses
  [`secmem_proc`] to prevent low-privileged processes from inspecting
  our memory or our monitoring our execution. This is another
  defense-in-depth mechanism.  ([#364], [!672])
- Arti now rejects attempts to run as root.  You can override this with
  with `application.allow_running_as_root`. ([#523], [!688])
- Arti now rejects attempts to run in a setuid environment: this is not
  something we support. ([#523], [!689], [!691])
- We now support having an `arti.d` directory full of `.toml`
  configuration files, to be read in sorted order. ([#271], [#474],
  [#544], [!682], [!697])
- On Unix-like platforms, we now reload our configuration file when we
  receive a `HUP` signal.  ([#316], [!702])

### Major bugfixes

- Numerous fixes to our [`fs-mistrust`] crate for Android and iOS,
  including some that prevented it from building or working correctly.
  ([!667])
- The [`fs-mistrust`] crate now handles Windows prefixes correctly.
  Previously, it would try to read `C:`, and fail. ([!698])

### Infrastructure

- The `check_licenses` tool now works with the latest version of
  `cargo-license`. ([!674])
- Our continuous integration configuration now has support for building and
  testing Arti on Windows. ([#450], [!705])

### Documentation

- Our documentation is now much more careful about listing which Cargo
  features are required for any optional items. ([#541], [!681], [!706])
- Better documentation about our API stability and overall
  design. ([#522], [#531])
- Better documentation on the `DONE` stream-close condition. ([!677])

### Cleanups, minor features, and minor bugfixes

- The `dns_port` and `socks_port` options have been renamed to
  `dns_listen` and `socks_listen`. They now support multiple
  addresses. Backward compatibility with the old options is
  retained. ([#502], [!602])
- Renamed `.inc` files to end with `.rs`, to help analysis
  tools. ([#381], [!645])
- Backend support for some cell types that we'll need down the road when
  we implement onion services. ([!651], [!648])
- Switch to the once-again-maintained main branch of [`shellexpand`].
  ([!661])
- Use less storage on disk for descriptors, by expiring them more
  aggressively. ([#527], [!669])
- Backend support for RTT estimation, as needed for congestion-based
  flow-control. ([!525])
- Running as a DNS proxy can now be disabled at compile-time, by
  turning off the `dns-proxy` feature. ([#532])
- When a circuit fails for a reason that was not the fault of the
  Tor network, we no longer count it against our total number of
  permitted circuit failures. ([#517], [!676])
- Tests for older configuration file formats. ([!684])
- Our default log messages have been cleaned up a bit, to make them
  more useful. ([!692], [0f133de6b90e799d], [e8fcf2b0383f49a6])
- We use [`safelog`] in more places, to avoid logging information that
  could be useful if the logs were stolen or accidentally
  leaked. ([!687], [!693])
- Fix a race condition that could prevent us from noticing multiple
  configuration changes in rapid succession. ([#544],
  [a7bb3a73b4dfb0e8])
- Better errors on invalid escapes in our configuration files. (In toml,
  you can't say `"C:\Users"`; you have to escape it as `"C:\\Users"`.
  We now try to explain this.) ([#549], [!695])
- Improve reliability of a `fs-mistrust` test. ([!699])
- Various tests have been adjusted to work on Windows, or disabled on Windows
  because they were checking for Unix-only features.  ([#450], [#557],
  [!696], [!701])
- When displaying filenames in logs or error messages, we try to
  replace the user's home directory with `${HOME}` or `%UserProfile%` as
  appropriate, to reduce the frequency with which the username appears
  in the logs. ([#555], [!700])

### Testing

- Lengthen a timeout in a `tor-rtcompat` test, to make it more reliable.
  ([#515], [!644])

- The `download_tolerance` configuration section has been renamed to
  `directory_tolerance`: It's not about tolerances at download time, but
  rather about how expired or premature a directory can be. The related
  `DirSkewTolerance` has also been renamed. ([#503], [!638])
- Several methods related to managing the [`Mistrust`] file-permissions
  object have been removed or changed, thanks to refactoring elsewhere.
  ([#483], [#640])

### Breaking changes in lower level crates

These changes should not break any code that only depends on the
[`arti_client`] APIs, but they will affect programs that use APIs from
lower-level crates to interact more closely with the Tor protocols.

- The `Error` types in all crates have been refactored to include far more
  accurate information about errors and their context.  This does not break
  the [`arti_client`] API, but it will affect anybody using lower-level
  crates. ([#323], [!614], [!616], [!619], [!620], [!625], [!628], [!638])
- The [`Writeable`] trait used to encode data, and related methods,
  are now fallible.  Previously they had no way to report errors.
  ([#513], [!623], [!640])
- The [`tor-cert`] APIs have been tweaked to support more compact
  internal representations and more idiomatic usage. ([#512], [!641], [!643])
- The [`NetDirProvider`] API, and related APIs in [`tor-dirmgr`], have been
  changed to support returning network directories with varying timeliness
  requirements. ([#528], [!642])
- The [`fs-mistrust`] API no longer supports certain operations related to
  unix groups, when built on iOS. ([!652])

### New features

- The internal [`tor-cert`] API now supports generating Tor-compatible
  certificates. ([#511], [!611])
- Improved API support for circuit handshakes that include external
  encrypted data, such as [`ntor-v3`] and [`hs-ntor`]. ([!618])

### Major bugfixes

- Fix a bug that prevented Arti from storing consensus files on
  Windows. Previously, we had generated filenames containing a colon, which
  Windows treats as a reserved character. ([#516], [!627])
- Fix compilation on iOS.  Our dependency on the [`rust-users`] crate
  had broken our ability to work correctly there. ([#519], [!652])

### Infrastructure

- Our license checker now tolerates complicated licenses with nested boolean
  expressions, by explicitly allow-listing the ones we like. ([!635])

### Cleanups, minor features, and minor bugfixes

- Upgrade to a newer version of [`base64ct`], and remove some work-around
  logic required for the older versions.  ([!608])
- Various typo fixes. ([!609], [!610], [!650])
- Upgrade to a pre-release version of
  [`x25519-dalek`] to avoid a hard dependency on an outdated version of
  [`zeroize`], so we can follow the latest version of the [`rsa`] crate.
  ([#448], [!612])
- Our client-global "dormant mode" flag is now published via a
  [`postage::watch`], which makes it easier to observe for changes. ([!632])
- Preliminary (unused) support for some onion-service-related cells.
  ([!626])
- The [`fs-mistrust`] crate can now use environment variables to be told to
  disable itself. This has allowed for simplifications elsewhere in our
  configuration logic. ([#483], [!630])
- Clean up an incorrect `--help` message. ([!633])

### Testing

- More tests for [`arti-hyper`]. ([!615])
- More tests for our undderlying base-64 implementation. ([!613])

# tor-dirmgr patch release 0.5.1 â€” 14 July 2022

On 14 July 2022, we put out a patch release (0.5.1) to `tor-dirmgr`, to fix
a bug that prevented Arti from storing consensus files on
Windows. Previously, we had generated filenames containing a colon, which
Windows treats as a reserved character.

Thanks to "@feelingnothing" for the bug report and the fix.



# Arti 0.5.0 â€” 24 Jun 2022

Arti 0.5.0 adds more cryptographic acceleration, a useful set of toplevel
build features, reachable-address filtering, detection for failed directory
downloads, and numerous cleanups.

Note that for the first time, we did _not_ have breaking changes in the
`arti-client` crate, so its version is staying at 0.4.1.

### Breaking changes

- The `NetDirProvider` trait now requires `Send` and
  `Sync`. ([2223398eb1670c15])
- The traits that make up `Runtime` now also require `Send` and
  `Sync`. ([3ba3b26842254cfd])
- The "journald" option for LoggingConfig now takes
  `Option<Into<String>>`. ([!582])
- (Various smaller breaking changes in lower-level crates.)

### New features

- We can now (optionally) use OpenSSL as our cryptography backend, for
  its better performance. To enable this, build with the `accel-openssl`
  feature. ([#441], [#442], [#493], [!550])
- We can now (optionally) use the assembly implementation of SHA1 in our
  cryptography backend, for its better performance.  To enable this,
  build with the `accel-sha1-asm` feature. ([#441], [!590])
- Our top-level crates (`arti` and `arti-client`) now have a `full`
  feature that enables _most_ of their optional featuresâ€”but not those
  that are unstable, those that are testing-only, those that select a
  particular implementation or build flag, or those whose licenses may
  be incompatible with some downstream licenses. ([#499], [!584])
- We now notice when we get stuck when trying to bootstrap a directory,
  and report the problem as part of our blockage-detection API. ([#468],
  [!587])
- We support a `reachable_addrs` feature that allows the user to tell
  Arti that only some addresses and/or ports are reachable over the
  local network.  ([#491], [#93], [!583])
- Our configuration logic now handles "no such value" options (like
  using "0" to mean "no port") more consistently, warns about
  unrecognized options, and includes tests to be sure that the "default
  configuration" file really lists all of the defaults.  ([#457],
  [#480], [#488], [!582], [!589], [!594])

### Infrastructure

- Our shell scripts are now more robust to a few different runtime
  environments. ([!539], [!541])
- Our license-checking code is more accurate and careful. ([#462], [!559])
- The PRNG logic in our unit tests now uses reproducible seeds,
  so that we can better diagnose issues related to sometimes-failing
  tests. ([!561])

### Cleanups, minor features, and minor bugfixes

- The `fs-mistrust` crate now handles environments where
  `getgrouplist()` doesn't include the current GID. ([#487], [!548])
- `dns_port` now de-duplicates requests based on transaction
   ID. ([#441], [!535])
- `dns_port` returns more accurate errors in several cases. ([!564])
- More unit tests in various places. ([!551], [!562])
- We avoid initializing a `DataStream` if it would immediately be
  closed. ([!556])
- We return a more useful error message for incorrect file permissions.
  ([!554])
- The directory manager code now uses a refactored timing backend that
  knows how to respect dormant mode. ([#497], [!571])
- Fix an unreliable test related to guard filtering. ([#491],
  [89f9e1decb7872d6])
- We now use a constant-time implementation of base-64
  decoding. ([#154], [!600])
- We now make sure that at least _some_ log messages can get reported
  before the logging is configured.  In particular, unknown
  configuration settings now generate warning messages on stderr when
  `arti` starts up.  ([!589])
- Many of our lower-level `Error` types have been refactored to give
  more accurate, useful, and best-practices-conformant messages.
  ([#323], [!598], [!601], [!604])

# Arti 0.4.0 â€” 27 May 2022

Arti 0.4.0 wraps up our changes to the configuration logic,
detects several kinds of unsafe filesystem configuration, and has a
refactored directory manager to help us tolerate far more kinds of broken
networks and invalid documents.

There are significant breaking changes in this release; please see
below.

### Breaking changes

- We've merged the last (we hope) of our breaking configuration changes.
  - Configuration and command-line loading is now handled consistently
    via the option-agnostic `tor-config` crate. ([!495], [!498])
  - We follow a uniform pattern where configuration objects are
    constructed from associated Builder types, and these Builders
    support [`serde`] traits, and everything provides a consistent
    API. ([!499], [!505], [!507])
  - The `arti-config` crate no longer exists: its functionality has been
    divided among `arti`, `arti-client`, and `tor-config`. ([!508])
  - The [`TorClientConfig`] object no longer implements
    `TryInto<DirMgrConfig>`.
  - The configuration logic now supports extensible configurations,
    where applications can add their own sections and keys without
    interfering with Arti, and unrecognized keys can still produce
    warnings. ([#459], [#417])
- The [`Runtime`] trait now also requires that `Debug` be implemented.
  ([!496])
- (Various smaller breaking changes in lower-level crates.)

### New features

- Arti now checks file permissions before starting up, and rejects
  configuration files, state files, and cache files if they can be modified
  by untrusted users. You can disable this feature with the
  `ARTI_FS_DISABLE_PERMISSION_CHECKS` environment variable.  ([#315],
  [#465], [!468], [!483], [!504], [!515])
- Arti now tolerates a much wider array of broken networks and
  installations when trying to bootstrap a working connection to the Tor
  network. This includes improved handling for skewed clocks,
  untimely documents, and invalid consensus documents.  ([#412], [#466],
  [#467], [!500], [!501], [!511])

### Major bugfixes

- Arti no longer exits or gets stuck when it has received a consensus
  with invalid signatures, or a consensus claiming to be signed with
  certificates that don't exist. ([#412], [#439], [!511])

### Infrastructure

- Clean up more effectively in chutney-based test
  scripts. ([ee9730cab4e4b21e])
- Nightly [coverage reports] are now generated and exported to gitlab
  pages. ([!489])
- We no longer include a dependency on [`cargo-husky`]: If you want to
  have [git hooks] in your local repository, you'll need to install your
  own. (See [CONTRIBUTING.md] for instructions.) ([!494])
- Our shell scripts are more uniform in their behaviour. ([!533])

### Documentation and Examples

- Better documentation for Cargo features. ([#445], [!496])
- Better explanation of what platforms and dependencies we support,
  and what "support" means anyway. ([#379], [!513])
- An advanced example of using the stream isolation feature for
  trickier behavior. ([#414], [!524])

### Cleanups, minor features, and minor bugfixes

- Use [`tinystr`] to hold relay nicknames; this should save a bit of
  memory. ([!405])
- Refactor the [`DirMgr`] crate's bootstrapping implementation to reduce
  amount of mutable state, reduce complexity, and reduce the amount of
  code that has to modify a running directory. ([!488])
- We only check the formatting of our backtraces on our target
  platforms, to better tolerate operating systems where Rust's
  backtraces don't correctly include function details. ([#455], [!512])
- [`DirMgr`] is now better at remembering the origin
  of a piece of directory information. ([ef2640acfaf9f873])
- Used a new [`Sink::prepare_send_from`] helper to simplify the
  implementation of Channel reactors. ([!514])
- The SOCKS code now sends correct error messages under more
  circumstances. ([#258], [!531])

# Arti 0.3.0 â€” 6 May 2022

Arti 0.3.0 includes several new features, including an improved
configuration builder API, improved detection and tolerance
of numerous network failure types, and several important bugfixes.

There are significant breaking changes in this release; please see
below.

### Breaking changes

Here are the main breaking changes visible from the arti-client crate.
Numerous other lower-level crates have breaking changes not noted here.

- We now require Rust 1.56 or later. This change enables us to use more
  recent versions of several of our dependencies, including a
  significantly faster `aes`.  ([!472])
- Some unused accessors have been removed from
  `tor-socksproto`. ([3103549cba603173])
- Our configuration logic and APIs have been significantly revised.
  Major changes are described below.  We expect that we're mostly
  done with breaking changes in this area, though we expect a few
  minor API breaks here in the next release.
  - Lists of objects, and contained configuration objects, are
    now constructed using a uniform pattern.
  - All of our config _builder_ types are now `Deserialize`; our
    configuration types themselves are not.
  - Various types are now more consistently constructed, which breaks
    some of the APIs.
  - Paths can now be given as "literal" paths, which will not be
    expanded.
  - Several options have been renamed for consistency.
  - For background see [#451], [!447], [!462], [!471], [!473], [!474],
    [!475], [!477], [!478], [!481], and [!487].

### New features

- Arti now tracks clock skew reports from the guard relays and
  fallback directories that we contact, and uses this information to
  infer whether our clock is actually skewed, and whether this skew is
  the likely cause of a failure to bootstrap. ([!450], [!455])
- We now remove obsolete files from our state directory. ([#282])
- More objects from `tor-dirmgr` are now exposed when the
  `experimental-api` feature is enabled. ([!463])
- Arti now has a feature to avoid logging certain sensitive information to
  persistent logs at level `info` or higher.  When safe logging is
  enabled (which it is, by default), the string `[scrubbed]` is printed
  in these contexts, rather than the sensitive information.
  At present, only target addresses are considered sensitive, though
  we aim to protect more information moving forward.  This feature can
  be disabled with the configuration option
  `storage.log_sensitive_information`.  ([#189], [!485])

### Major bugfixes

- Our circuit-build logic is now much more careful about which errors are
  retriable, and how long to wait between attempts. ([#421], [!443])
- We resolved a race condition that could cause internal errors to be
  reported erroneously during circuit construction. ([#427])
- We no longer interpret a successful circuit as meaning that a
  guard is working _as a directory_.  Even if it can build circuits, it
  may be unable to answer directory requests to our satisfaction.
  ([b3e06b93b6a34922])

### Infrastructure

- Our CI infrastructure now correctly detects (and reports!) failures
  from cargo-audit.  ([!452])

### Cleanups, minor features, and minor bugfixes

- We report more accurate and useful messages on failure to build a
  circuit. ([f7810d42eb953bf5])
- Avoid dropping information when reloading guards. ([#429])
- Arti now treats expired or not-yet-valid directory objects as an error
  condition, since they indicate that the directory cache (or the
  client) likely has a skewed clock. ([#431])
- We now back off on attempts to build preemptive circuits, if we find
  that those attempts are failing.  ([#437], [!456])
- As part of the configuration refactoring, we've extended the amount of
  our configuration builders that are auto-generated. ([!462])
- Improve handling of some integer overflows. ([!466])
- More unit tests throughout the code.

# Arti 0.2.0 â€” 1 Apr 2022

Arti 0.2.0 makes a large number of changes to Arti's code and
infrastructure for better configurability, lower memory usage, support
for running as a basic DNS resolver, improved stream isolation, better
behavior under network failures, and API support for a "dormant mode" to
suspend background activities.

### Breaking changes

Here are the main breaking changes visible from the arti-client crate.
Numerous other lower-level crates have breaking changes not noted here.

- Significant refactoring to our configuration handling logic and APIs.
  The goals here are:
      - To have the `ConfigBuilder` objects be the primary configuration
        objects, and simplify the handling of configuration at the
        `TorClient` and `arti` APIs.
      - To remove `arti-config` entirely, and fold its contents into
        `arti` or `arti-client` as appropriate.
      - To remove unnecessary ad-hoc accessor functions until they prove to be
        needed.

  This change is not done in this release; we expect to have more
  breakage in this area in our next release as well.  ([#314], [#371],
  [#372], [#374], [#396], [#418], [!391], [!401], [!417], [!421],
  [!423], [!425], [!427])
- The [`Runtime`] trait now includes (and requires) UDP support. (Part
  of [!390]'s support for DNS.)
- Stream isolation support is completely revised; see notes on isolation
  below.

### New features

- Experimental feature to allow the [`DirMgr`] to be replaced by
  a user-provided [`DirProvider`]. ([#267], [!318], [!347])
- Arti now tolerates IPv6-only environments, by using a basic form of
  the [RFC 8305] "happy eyeballs" algorithm to try connections to
  relays' IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in parallel. ([!382])
- New experimental APIs for modifying consensus objects. ([!318], [!402])
- The `arti` crate now exists as a library, to better expose features
  like its top-level configuration logic. ([!403])
- Arti now supports a `dns_port` to relay A, AAAA, and PTR requests over
  the Tor network, like the C tor implementation's DnsPort. ([!390],
  [!408], [!409])
- Arti has a new full-featured [stream isolation API] that supports more
  complicated isolation rules, including user-supplied rules.  ([#150],
  [#414], [!377], [!418], [!420], [!429], [!434])
- Channel and Circuit objects now remember the peers that they used
  when they were constructed, and allow queries of this information as
  part of their API. ([#415])
- The logic for retrying failed guards has been revised to use
  the same decorrelated-jitter algorithm as directory requests, per
  [proposal 336]. ([cb103e04cf4d9853], part of. ([#407], [!426])
- When all our guards have failed, we no longer retry them all
  aggressively, but rather assume that our net connection is down and
  wait a while. ([eed1f06662366511], part of. ([#407], [!426])
- When running as a directory client, we now remember more information
  about the source of each request, so we can avoid caches that have
  failed. ([87a3f6b58a5e75f7])
- Experimental feature to install a "filter" for modifying incoming
  directory objects.  Used for testing, to observe client behavior when
  the directory is in an inconsistent or non-working state. ([#397], [!431])
- Arti now has initial support for a "Dormant Mode" where periodic events are
  suspended. Later, even more background tasks will be shut
  down. ([#90], [!429], [!436])
- Fallback directory caches are now handled with logic similar to guards,
  so we can avoid ones that aren't working, and simplify our logic for
  path construction.  As a fringe benefit, this unification means that
  we can now use our guards as directory caches even when we don't have
  an up-to-date consensus. ([#220], [#406], [!433])


### Infrastructure

- We have a new [`arti-testing`] crate (not published on crates.io) to
  perform various kinds of stress-testing on our implementation. It can
  simulate several kinds of failure and overload conditions; we've been
  using it to improve Arti's behavior when the network is broken or
  misbehaving. See also [#329]. ([#397], [!378], [!392], [!442])
- The [`arti-bench`] tool now constructs streams in parallel and
  supports isolated circuits, so we can
  stress-test the performance of a simulated busy client. ([#380], [!384])
- Reproducible build scripts now use Rust 1.59 and Alpine 3.15. ([#376],
  [!380])
- Improved messages from reproducible build script. ([#378], [!383])
- Scripts to launch chutney are now refactored and de-duplicated. ([!396])

### Documentation and Examples

- Better documentation for default configuration paths. ([!386])
- Instructions for using Tor Browser with Arti on Windows. ([!388])
- Better instructions for building Arti on Windows. ([!389], [!393])
- Improved documentation for stress-testing Arti. ([!407])

### Cleanups, minor features, and minor bugfixes

- Use [`derive_more`] and [`educe`] (and simple built-in `derive`) in
  many places to simplify our code. ([!374], [!375])
- Use a [forked version of `shellexpand`] to provide correct behavior on
  Windows. ([!274], [!373])
- Avoid unnecessary `Arc::clone()`s in `arti-client` experimental
  APIs. ([#369], [!379])
- New [`tor-basic-utils`] crates for small pieces of low-level
  functionality.
- Small performance improvements to parsing and allocating directory objects,
  to improve start-up and download times. ([#377], [!381])
- Use significantly less memory (on the order of a few megabytes less per
  running client) to store directory objects. ([#384], [#385], [#386], [#387],
  [#388], [!389], [!398], [!415])
- Avoid allocating a backtrace object for each channel-creation
  attempt. ([#383], [!394])
- Always send an "If-Modified-Since" header on consensus requests, since
  we wouldn't want a consensus that was far too old. ([#403], [!412])
- Actually use the configuration for preemptive circuit construction.
  Previously, we missed a place where we needed to copy it.  ([!417])
- Backend support for collecting clock skew information; not yet
  used. ([#405], [!410])
- Major refactoring for periodic events, to support an initial version of
  "dormant mode." ([!429])
- Remove most uses of `SystemTime::now`, in favor of calling the equivalent
  function on [`SleepProvider`]. ([#306], [!365])
- Several bugs in the logic for retrying directory downloads
  have been fixed, and several parameters have been tuned, to lead to
  better behavior under certain network failure conditions. ([!439])

# Arti 0.1.0 â€” 1 Mar 2022

Arti 0.1.0 marks another important step towards stability, and the
completion of our 0.1.0 milestone.  With this milestone, we now consider
Arti ready for experimental embedding within other applications.

Additionally with this release, we're now ready to declare the
`arti_client` API more or less stable and supported.  (We're not
committing to never break it again in the future, but we'll try not to
do so without pretty good reasons.)  The 1.0.0 release, scheduled for
this September, will represent an even stronger API commitment.


### Breaking changes

- Our top-level `Error` type is now a mostly-opaque wrapper around an
  inner hidden `ErrorDetail` type.  (You can access `ErrorDetail` by
  enabling a feature, but it breaks your semver guarantees.) To
  distinguish among different kinds of `Error`s, we provide a supported
  (and hopefully stable) `ErrorKind` API that developers can use.
  ([!262], [!291], [!325], [#322], [#348])
- The interface to construct a `TorClient` instance has been completely
  replaced.  The new API should be stable, and prevent the need for
  additional breaking changes in the future. ([#350], [!364], [#326])
- Many smaller changes, too numerous to list.  (Starting _after_ this
  release, we will try be much more careful about breaking changes, and
  note them specifically here.)
- We no longer recommend the `static` feature flag; instead use
  `static-native-tls` or `static-sqlite` as appropriate. ([#302])

### New features

- The Arti client can now watch its configuration files to see if they change,
  and reconfigure itself when they do. This is controlled by a
  `watch_configuration` option, and is off-by-default. ([#270], [!280])
- Unused channels now expire after enough time has passed.  (This is
  mostly not needed on the client side, since relays also expire
  unused channels.) ([#41], [!273])
- You can now create an unbootstrapped TorClient object, so that you can
  observe its bootstrapping progress and/or bootstrap it
  at a later time.  ([#293], [!298])
- You can configure an unbootstrapped TorClient object to automatically
  bootstrap itself the first time it's used. ([!322])
- Arti now returns a webpage with an error message if you try to use its
  SOCKS proxy as an HTTP proxy. ([!348])
- We now provide an [arti-hyper] crate for using Arti with the [hyper] HTTP
  library.  This is also good example code for showing how to integrate Arti
  with other tools. ([!342], [!355]]

### Major bugfixes

- Fixed a number of problems in the circuit Reactor implementation that
  could result in cell reordering, leading to relays closing our circuits
  because of protocol violations. ([!264], [!282])
- Fixed bugs that could cause strange behavior on shutdown or failure
  during circuit construction. ([#210], [#365], [!363], [!366], [!368])

### Infrastructure

- Numerous CI improvements.
- Numerous coverage-testing improvements.
- We renamed our shell and python scripts to remove their ".sh" and
  ".py" suffixes, so that we can more freely change their
  implementations in the future (if needed). ([#309])
- The `DirMgr` crate now uses an abstract `Store` trait to make it
  easier for us to implement new storage backends in the
  future. ([!345], [!317])

### Documentation and Examples

- Provide better sample code for `TorClient::connect`. ([!303])
- Provide an example for how to make a [lazy-initialized] `TorClient`
  object. ([#278], [!322])
- Provide an example for how to [override the default TCP-connect]
  implementation. ([!341], [!356])

### Cleanups, minor features, and minor bugfixes

- Stop using `:` as a path character; it's reserved on Windows. ([!277])
- Avoid returning junk data from over-long directory downloads. ([!271])
- Implement Debug and Display for many more types.
- We no longer `deny(clippy::all)`; instead we only use
  `warn(clippy::all)` to prevent future clippy versions from breaking
  completely on our code. ([#338])
- As part of our `Error` refactoring and implementation of `ErrorKind`,
  we improved the Error objects in many individual crates for better
  accuracy and specificity.
- Fix a bug that caused us to flush our persistent state to disk too
  aggressively. ([#320], [!321])
- The `arti` proxy now starts listening on its SOCKS port immediately,
  rather than waiting for bootstrapping to complete. ([!333])

# Arti 0.0.4 â€” 31 Jan 2022

This release adds support for bootstrap reporting and `rustls`,
improves several APIs, fixes a few bugs, and adds numerous smaller
features for future-proofing and correctness.

It breaks compatibility with previous releases, as is expected before
release 0.1.0 (scheduled March 2022).

### New features

- Add backends for exposing changes in bootstrap status, either to be
  queried by a function or read as a stream of events.  These APIs
  will become more useful once there is a way to actually get an
  un-bootstrapped `TorClient`. ([#96])
- `TorClient` now has a `clone_with_prefs` method to make a new client
  with a different set of default stream
  preferences. ([7ff16fc252c0121f6607], [#290]])
- Add a feature for telling a `TorClient` that every stream should be
  isolated on its own circuit. Please use this sparingly; it can be
  inefficient. ([!252])
- Convenience types for overriding parts of the behavior of an
  asynchronous  `Runtime`. ([!251])
- Optional support for `rustls` in place of `native_tls`. This is off
  by default; to turn it on, use the `rustls` feature, and construct
  your client using one of the `Runtime`s with `Rustls` in its name.
  ([!260], [#86])

### Breaking changes

- Significant refactoring of exports and constructor functions
  in the `arti-client` crate. ([!235])
- Change the persistence format used for guard information, to make it more
  future-proof. ([#176])
- Functions and types that used to refer to "Connections" now refer to
  "Streams" for consistency. ([!256])
- The types exported by the `tor-rtcompat` crate, and the functions
  used to create them, have been renamed for consistency. ([!263])
- The `Runtime` API has changed slightly, to avoid a conflict with
  newer versions of `async_executors`.  ([bf8fa66d36298561cc86])

### Major bugfixes

- Require authenticated SENDMEs when the relay supports them, and not
  otherwise. ([#294])
- Fix the default location for the cache files. (Previously, they were
  put into the state directory.) ([#297])

### Infrastructure

- Numerous improvements to coverage tooling. ([#248], [!221], [!269], [!253])
- Improvements to `arti-bench` reliability and usefulness. ([#292])
- Our CI now runs `shellcheck` on our shell scripts. ([#275])

### Documentation

- Build instructions for iOS. ([#132])
- Adopt a MSRV policy. ([#283])
- More information about troubleshooting the build process. ([#277])

### Cleanups, minor features, and minor bugfixes

- The `max_file_limit` setting is now configurable. ([#299])
- Fix an unreliable test. ([#276])
- Fix a test that would always fail when run after January 27. ([!268])
- Avoid possible incomplete reads and writes in Tor channel
  handshake. ([1d5a480f79e7d878ff], [!249]])
- Refactor some types to expose `Arc<>` less often. ([!236])
- Too many others to list!

# Arti 0.0.3 â€” 11 Jan 2022

This release adds support for preemptive circuit construction, refactors
Arti's configuration code and behavior, and adds numerous smaller features
needed for a correct Tor client implementation.

It breaks compatibility with previous releases, as is expected before
release 0.1.0 (scheduled March 2022).

### New features

- Arti now builds preemptive circuits in order to anticipate the user's
  predicted needs.  This change matches Tor's behavior more closely, and
  should reduce latency for stream creation. ([!154])
- The configuration for a [`TorClient`] object can be changed while the
  client is running. ([!181])
- Guard selection now obeys family restrictions concerning exit nodes.
  ([!139])
- Better support for overriding the [`TcpProvider`] on an Arti client and
  having this change affect the [`TlsProvider`]. This helps with testing
  support, with cases where TCP streams must be constructed specially, etc.
  ([!166])
- We no longer consider a directory to be "complete" until we have
  microdescriptors for all of our primary guards. ([!220])

### Breaking changes

- Configuration files have been reorganized, and we have an all-new API for
  creating configuration objects. ([!135], [!137])
- A few unused types and functions have been removed. ([214c251e] etc)
- `CircMgr` now returns `ClientCirc` directly, not wrapped in an `Arc`.
  (ClientCirc instances are already cheap to clone.) ([!224])
- `TorClient` now has separate `connect` and `connect_with_prefs` methods.
  ([!229])
- Various other API refactorings and revisions. (Please remember that we plan
  to break backward compatibility with _every_ release between now and 0.1.0
  in early March.)

### Major bugfixes

- We fixed a bug in handling stream-level SENDMEs that would sometimes result
  in an Arti client sending too much data, causing the exit relay to close
  the circuit. ([!194])

### Infrastructure

- We now have an experimental benchmarking tool to compare Arti's performance
  with Tor's, when running over a chutney network. So far, we seem
  competitive, but we'll probably find cases where we underperform. ([!195])
- Our coverage tool now post-processes grcov's output to produce per-crate
  results. ([!163])
- Our integration test scripts are more robust to cases where the user has
  already configured a `CHUTNEY_PATH`. ([!168])
- We have lowered the required dependency versions in our Cargo.toml files
  so that each one is the lowest version that actually works with our code.
  ([!227])

### Cleanups, minor features, and minor bugfixes

- We store fewer needless fields from Tor directory documents. ([!151],
  [!165])
- We've gone through and converted _every_ <code>XX&#88;X</code> comment in our code (which
  indicated a must-fix issue) into a ticket, or a `TODO`. ([#231])
- Our SOCKS code is much more careful about sending error messages if
  an error occurs before the SOCKS connection succeeds. ([!189])
- We no longer build non-directory circuits when the consensus is
  super-old. ([!90])
- We no longer consider timeouts to indicate that our circuits are all timing
  out unless we have seen _some_ recent incoming network traffic. ([!207])
- You can now configure logging to files, with support for rotating the
  files hourly or daily. You can have separate filters for each logging
  target. ([!222])
- Too many others to list!

# Arti 0.0.2 â€” 30 Nov 2021

This release tries to move us towards a more permanent API, and sets the
stage for future work in performance evaluation and event reporting.

It breaks compatibility with previous releases, as is expected before
release 0.1.0 (scheduled March 2022).

### New features

- Warn if guard restrictions are too strict. ([#242])
- Optimistic data is now supported on streams, and used by default on
  directory requests. ([#23])
- Initial cut at a typed event framework. Not yet used, but will eventually
  take the role of Tor's "controller event" system.  ([#230])
- Large rewrite of configuration handling system, with more ergonomic
  builders for top-level configurations. ([#84])


### Breaking changes

- The `${APP_*}` path variables have been renamed to
  `${ARTI_*}`. ([efdd3275])
- The configuration file format has been substantially revised. ([#84])
- Most code that clients don't need is now behind a cargo feature. ([#124])
- Revised APIs in many other high-level crates.

### Documentation

- Many other improvements and rewrites.

### Infrastructure

- Update our `cargo-husky` scripts to better match our CI. ([!62])
- Use grcov, not tarpaulin. ([!136])

### Cleanups, minor features, and bugfixes

- Huge refactoring of the `tor-proto` crate to conform more closely to the
  reactor architecture, and reduce the need for locks. ([#205], [#217])
- By default, `cargo build --release` now chooses a more aggressive set
  of optimization flags. ([!124])
  - Too many smaller fixes to list.

# Arti 0.0.1 â€” 29 Oct 2021

This release attempts to be "free of known privacy holes". That
isn't to say that there are no remaining bugs, but rather that we've
implemented the missing features that we think are essential for
basic privacy.

### New features

- Persistent state on disk. ([#59])
- Allow multiple Arti instances to share directories. ([#194])
- Support for EnforceDistinctSubnets. ([#43])
- Configurable logging ([!68]) to journald. ([!73])
- Rejecting attempts to connect to internal addresses. ([#85])
- Support for Tor `RESOLVE` and `RESOLVE_PTR` [socks extensions]. ([#33])

- Renamed `arti-tor-client` to `arti-client`. ([#130])
- Stopped exposing `anyhow` errors. ([#165])
- CLI now uses `clap`, and uses subcommands. ([!109])
- Too many others to list.

### Documentation
